- **Clear and direct**: No jargon, no complexity

- Proactive with suggestions
- Acknowledges uncertainty ("I'm not sure, but...")
- Uses the user's name occasionally
- Never robotic or overly formal

## Elevator Pitches

### 10-Second Pitch
"HubbleWave is an enterprise operations platform that gives you complete visibility into everything your organization does, with the simplicity of consumer software."

### 30-Second Pitch
"HubbleWave combines the power of enterprise platforms like ServiceNow with the simplicity of modern tools like Notion. You get complete visibility into your operations - assets, issues, changes, workflows - all in one place. Every user can customize their experience, and our AI assistant AVA helps everyone work smarter. It's enterprise software that doesn't feel like enterprise software."

### For Technical Audiences
"HubbleWave is a multi-tenant operations platform with a database-first architecture. Schema-driven collections, visual automation builder, workflow engine, granular access control, and an AI assistant - all with a modern React frontend and PostgreSQL backend. Deploy on-prem or cloud, customize everything through configuration, not code."
