# HubbleWave Clinical + Facilities Asset Maintenance — Architecture + Implementation Spec

**Status:** Approved architecture spec; implementation-detail inline expansion in progress per §13.
**Branch:** `phase4/clinical-facilities-pack-design` (off master).
**Authored:** 2026-05-16 (brainstorm); approved 2026-05-17.
**Format:** Mega-spec inline — every substrate section + pack + marquee specified in this single document per user direction. §3.1 carries the full artifact-level detail as the template; §3.2-§3.18 expansions land in subsequent commits on this branch.

---

## 1. Context

A real RFP is in flight. The customer is currently evaluating **Nuvolo** (clinical/facilities CMMS on ServiceNow) and **ServiceNow's own Planned Maintenance + FSM** modules. HubbleWave must compete with both, hit every feature, and win on three specific pain points the customer has named:

1. **Nuvolo mobile is slow.** Field technicians abandon it. We must be visibly faster on a real device in a hospital setting (intermittent connectivity, dirty environment, gloves).
2. **ServiceNow's `task` polymorphic root has 20M+ rows.** List queries take minutes to load. The data-model decision that locked ServiceNow into that pain is the one we must not repeat.
3. **The customer loves ServiceNow's Workspaces + UI Builder.** Canon §27 already commits to feature parity; the pack must deliver the dog-food proof (every OOTB workspace built via UI Builder).

The HubbleWave platform's 2026-05-09 spec (Appendix D, lines 1558-1635) pre-inventoried Clinical/Facilities Asset Management as deferred pack work and asserted "the platform's customization surface is sufficient to deliver this entire inventory." This plan tests that assertion against full-vertical scope (CMMS + FSM + Parts + Compliance + Integrations + Predictive AI) and identifies the substrate additions the vertical legitimately presses on.

**Outcome we are designing for:** a substrate pack + three vertical overlays that ship together, win the RFP, and prove the canon §17.5 customization contract on a real domain — without violating greenfield discipline (canon §1), without bypassing upgrade safety (canon §13), and without re-implementing the architectural mistakes Nuvolo inherited from ServiceNow.

## 1.1 Implementation Priority (preconditions cleared 2026-05-17)

This vertical is compliance-heavy and depends on identity + authorization invariants that the current Phase 3 W2 work hardens. The three preconditions originally listed here have now been resolved into the executable plan:

1. **W2 Stream 1 platform-blocker cleanup — ✅ CLEARED** at tag `phase3-w2-complete` (commit `fe71976`, merged to master 2026-05-17). The role-code vs role-id auth mismatch resolution, migration/package coherence fixes, and scanner baseline (13 architectural scanners green) all shipped across 16 PRs in the W2 wave. Per the [W2 close commit](https://github.com/adi-hw/HW-Platform-/commit/7abb5bf): "boundary consistency landed across identity / authz / audit / search / scanner enforcement". G0a inherits this baseline.

2. **Pack capability contract** (§8 §17.5 amendment) — **converted into pre-flight PR-A1 of G0a**. The pack-validator extension (accepting `requires_capabilities`, `provides_capabilities`, `capability_bindings`, `task_projection.attrs[]`, `public_intake.schemas[]`, connector simulator declarations, reserved-namespace signing) lands as the first executable PR of G0a. Without this extension, no substrate PR's pack manifest can declare its capability bindings. See implementation plan §3 (G0a PR-A1).

3. **Metadata safety fields on `PropertyDefinition`** — **converted into pre-flight PR-A2 of G0a**. The migration adding `projection_safe`, `confidentiality_class`, `break_glass_eligible`, `sync_to_mobile`, `taskable_field_mapping`, `vector_indexed` columns lands BEFORE any substrate PR that consumes them. The columns are nullable on the migration; downstream substrate PRs (§13.8 mobile parity, §13.11 break-glass, §13.14 vector match, etc.) populate them as their pack publish requirements are introduced. See implementation plan §3 (G0a PR-A2 + PR-A3).

**Status:** All three preconditions cleared. Precondition #1 by W2 wave completion; preconditions #2 + #3 by reclassification into the executable PR sequence as G0a pre-flight PRs (PR-A1, PR-A2, PR-A3) at the start of week 1. G0a is now startable.

## 2. Architectural Ruling (load-bearing decisions, founder-locked)

**Thesis.** *Platform supplies generic capability contracts and scalable read/runtime primitives; `maintenance-core` is the first HubbleWave-owned pack that composes them into CMMS/FSM, with Clinical and Facilities overlays proving specialization without schema inheritance or platform bypass.*

These four decisions set destiny for everything that follows. Each was an explicit choice between defensible alternatives.

1. **Composition over inheritance for tasks.** `MaintenanceWorkOrder` is its own domain table (`cust__hw_maintenance__work_order`) with its own indexes, partitions, lifecycle, archive policy. It does NOT inherit from a polymorphic root. The platform exposes a **`taskable` capability** that any collection opts into by exposing the required semantic fields (number, title, state, priority, assignment, due date, SLA, lifecycle, requester, timeline). A rebuildable **`task_projection`** read model powers global queues, search, and cross-collection workspaces — never the source of truth, never the surface a 20M-row list query hits.

2. **Substrate + two overlays.** One `maintenance-core` pack contains all vertical-agnostic content. `clinical-maintenance` and `facilities-maintenance` are thin overlays that add only vertical-specific entities, fields, workflows, role models, and integrations. Customers install Core + chosen overlay(s); both can coexist on one instance. GxP/regulated workflows are cross-cutting via a `regulated-action` platform capability, not Clinical-only.

3. **HubbleWave-owned packs follow the customer-pack contract.** Maintenance-core, clinical-maintenance, and facilities-maintenance live under the same upgrade-safety validator (spec §5.4), the same namespace rules (`cust__{pack}__{collection}`), the same plugin SDK stability promises (§25). No platform-pack admin bypass. We eat our own dog food on the customization moat that differentiates us from ServiceNow.

4. **AI dispatch + predictive maintenance live in maintenance-core, not in overlays.** Both verticals benefit from the same scoring and routing primitives. The vertical-specific tuning happens in pack-shipped data (sample assets, calibrated thresholds), not in code. Per canon §12, every AI feature ships in Suggest mode by default; customer admin opts in to higher trust levels per-feature.

---

## 3. Platform Substrate Additions (Phase 1a + 1b + 1c — 18 substrate sections, ~42 PRs)

Each addition is a platform capability that the maintenance verticals press on, structurally universal enough to live in the platform substrate (not in the pack). Each requires a canon amendment. **Without these, packs reinvent shared primitives (AVA semantic match, connector simulation, spatial graph, document provenance, financial controls, bulk import staging, NAC egress safety) and the §17.5 customization contract quietly turns into "custom platform code wearing a pack costume."**

Split across three gates per §5.3:
- **G0a (foundation)**: §3.1 taskable + §3.2 task_projection skeleton + §3.3 scheduling + §3.4 list-scale framework + §3.5 observations base + §3.6 regulated-action single-signature.
- **G0b (advanced)**: task_projection circuit-breaker + tombstones + reconciliation, regulated-action Merkle batch, §3.7 mobile parity, §3.8 AVA UI synthesis, §3.9 public intake hardened, §3.10 break-glass override, §3.11 external-collaborator sessions, observation rollup jobs.
- **G0c (shared substrate for marquees #23-35)**: §3.12 Storage/Evidence runtime + §3.13 Connector runtime + simulators + §3.14 Semantic Search/Vector Match + §3.15 Spatial+Graph + §3.16 Financial Control + §3.17 Bulk Import Staging + §3.18 Integration Secrets + Egress Policy. These are the shared substrates that prevent packs from inventing ad-hoc versions.

### 3.1 `taskable` capability (canon §30 NEW)
- **What:** Metadata-layer declaration on a `CollectionDefinition`. Collections that opt in expose a fixed semantic-field contract. NOT a base table.
- **New tables (schema `metadata`):** `taskable_capabilities` (~14 cols, FK to collection_definitions, JSONB field mapping, state-machine ref), `taskable_required_fields` (constraint denormalization).
- **Reused:** `StateMachineDefinition`, `SLADefinition` + `SLAInstance`, `ProcessFlowDefinition`, `Approval`, `ChoiceList`.
- **TypeORM placement:** new area file `libs/instance-db/src/lib/entities/capabilities.entity.ts`.

### 3.2 `task_projection` read model (canon §34 NEW)
- **What:** Denormalized, eventually consistent (sub-second under normal load) projection of every active taskable record across all opted-in collections. Powers global queues, search, mobile sync, workspaces.
- **New tables (schema `data`):** `task_projection` (~20 cols, **projection_safe columns only** — only fields whose `PropertyDefinition.projection_safe = true` AND whose `confidentiality_class` ∈ {`public`, `internal`} are eligible for the projection; pack authors declare projection_safety at publish; the validator refuses publish if a `taskable_capability` field-mapping references a property that is NOT projection_safe; runtime authz STILL post-filters every row through `AuthorizationService` — projection_safety is a STATIC publish-time gate, not the runtime gate. **`attrs_jsonb` is also schema-gated**: every projection JSON key must have a corresponding entry in the pack manifest's `task_projection.attrs[]` schema, each marked `projection_safe = true` with an allowed `confidentiality_class`; the projection writer rejects any attempt to write a key not in the schema (arbitrary attrs cannot smuggle sensitive data). PARTITION BY LIST `task_kind` then RANGE `opened_at` month; includes `deleted_at` for tombstones). `task_projection_archive` (cold partitions); `task_projection_lag` (per-collection cursor).
- **Refresh:** `apps/worker` (horizontally scaled — see §8 §19 amendment) runs `TaskProjectionConsumer` driven by `instance_event_outbox` rows via **Redis Consumer Groups (at-least-once delivery)**; the consumer achieves **effectively-once processing** through transactional idempotency: every outbox event carries a unique `event_id`; the **`processed_events` ledger insert AND the projection/domain mutation happen in the same DB transaction** (`INSERT ... ON CONFLICT (consumer_name, event_id) DO NOTHING` + projection UPSERT in one BEGIN/COMMIT); Redis XACK fires **only after DB commit** — crash between mutation and XACK results in a re-delivery that no-ops via the ledger. Projection writes are idempotent UPSERTs keyed on source-record-id + source-version; tombstones are retry-safe.
- **`processed_events` table policy.** Schema `automation` (or `data`); partitioned by RANGE on `received_at` (monthly). pg_partman auto-creates partitions. Retention: 90 days default (much longer than any reasonable redelivery window); older partitions detached and dropped by `processed_events_steward.job.ts`. Per consumer-name ledger keyed on `(consumer_name, event_id)`. Otherwise the table grows forever.
- Consumer handles `record.write` (upsert), `record.delete` (tombstone), `rule.invalidate` (bucket rebuild). Optimistic write-back-read for the actor's own session.
- **Circuit-breaker degradation (lag > 30s).** **List views do NOT fall back to source-table queries** under burst load — fallback would thunder-herd the source partitions and cascade-fail the instance. Instead: serve stale projection rows with a `"Syncing… results up to {last_projected_at}"` banner; refuse new pagination cursors past the staleness window. **Single-record fetches** can fallback to source (low cardinality, no herd risk). Threshold + behavior controlled per `task_kind` via `task_projection_lag.circuit_open_above_seconds`.
- **Authz contract (security, not optimization).** Every list read passes through `AuthorizationService` for record-visibility (§28.1) and field-masking (§28.5) — no exception. The projection row is a candidate, not an authorization. **Projection_safety is a static publish-time gate** that decides what columns are EVEN ELIGIBLE to live in the projection (PropertyDefinition.projection_safe + permitted confidentiality_class); runtime authz still post-filters every row. The cached `customer_acl_hash` bucket strategy is an OPTIMIZATION that pre-filters candidate rows by a precomputed principal-set signature, reducing the volume centralized authz must evaluate; it is never the gate. Stale projection rows (post-rule-edit, pre-rebuild) cannot grant access because the centralized post-filter is unconditional.
- **Bucket invalidation.** A `CollectionAccessRule` edit emits an outbox event consumed by `TaskProjectionConsumer`; the affected bucket-hash is recomputed and rows re-tagged. During rebuild, list views serve from the stale-but-correct projection (centralized authz post-filter still enforced); single-record reads can fall through to source.
- **Tombstones + reconciliation.** Source deletes emit a tombstone row (`deleted_at` set) — kept for the read-through window, then GC'd. A scheduled `task_projection_reconciler` worker job walks each `task_kind`/month partition pair (source ↔ projection) on a slow cadence (default daily) and produces a per-row diff: missing-in-projection (reproject), orphan-in-projection (tombstone), stale-by-version (reproject). Reconciliation lag visible in the Maintenance Manager workspace.
- **Search:** Typesense feeds via the same `SearchSource` / `SearchIndexState` rail packs use today.

### 3.3 Scheduling primitives (canon §35 NEW)
- **What:** Recurrence, suppression windows, blackout calendars, shift calendars, utilization-triggered scheduling, idempotent record generation. **Generic** — the platform primitive knows nothing about PM, WO, or assets; the maintenance-core pack binds those semantics on top.
- **New tables (schema `automation`):** `recurrence_definitions`, `suppression_windows`, `blackout_calendars`, `shift_calendars`, `generation_runs` (generic idempotency ledger — `(id, source_collection_id, source_record_id, subject_collection_id, subject_record_id, fire_at, generated_collection_id, generated_record_id, idempotency_key text UNIQUE, run_kind varchar(64), created_at)`; the maintenance-core pack binds PM semantics on top — platform table holds no asset/PM/WO coupling, and the same ledger serves any future scheduled-generation domain).
- **RRULE library:** `libs/scheduling/` wraps a trusted RFC-5545 implementation (rrule.js).
- **Reused:** `BusinessHours`, `ScheduledJob`, `AutomationExecutionLog`, `RuntimeAnomaly`.

### 3.4 List-scale primitives (folded into §34 amendment)
- **What:** Three mechanisms: materialized list snapshots for huge canned views, active/archive partitioning per `taskable_capability` (default `archive_age_months = 24`, never deleted), denormalized mobile list payload endpoint (`GET /mobile/tasks/sync`).
- **New tables (schema `data`):** `list_snapshots`, `list_snapshot_rows` (partitioned by `snapshot_id`).
- **Compliance answer for 7-year archive recall:** explicit `archive_query_facade.ts` opens cold partitions on regulator request; slow (minutes) but correct, and audit-logged.

### 3.5 Time-series observations (canon §31 NEW)
- **What:** Asset meter readings (IR, vibration, runtime hours, refrigerant pressures, BMS setpoints) stored in partitioned Postgres tables. Supports condition-based PM, predictive ML feature extraction, dashboards.
- **New tables (schema `observations` — new schema):** `observation_streams` (~14 cols, **generic subject binding** via `subject_collection_id` + `subject_record_id` + `stream_kind varchar(64)` — no domain FK to asset; the maintenance pack binds asset/meter semantics on top, the platform table works for any future observable domain), `observations` (RANGE-partitioned monthly via **pg_partman** auto-managed partitions, ~9 cols — subject reference lives on the stream, not on every reading; keeps the hot partitioned table narrow and avoids domain leakage into the platform), `observation_units` (seeded), **`observation_rollups_hourly` / `observation_rollups_daily` / `observation_rollups_weekly`** — explicit rollup tables (NOT materialized views, NOT pg_ivm — pg_ivm's README requires non-partitioned base tables and its immediate-maintenance mode degrades under high-volume writes); each rollup table maintained by a scheduled SQL upsert job in the worker (parameterized `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT (stream_id, bucket_start) DO UPDATE` with the SQL aggregation running in Postgres, not the Node worker — the worker only issues the statement and tracks lag). `observation_alerts` (optional, threshold-based; references `stream_id` only).
- **Decision (Day-1 — revised twice).** Adopt **pg_partman from Day 1** for automated partition creation/retention on `observations`. **Reject pg_ivm** for v1: per its own documentation, its base tables must be simple (non-partitioned) tables, and immediate-maintenance mode adds write-time overhead unsuitable for high-volume sensor ingest. Rollups land in explicit purpose-built tables refreshed by **scheduled SQL upsert jobs** running in Postgres (the worker issues the statement and observes lag; the aggregation math runs entirely in the database). **TimescaleDB remains a deferred escape valve** for >10B observations/instance, where its continuous-aggregate primitive becomes operationally compelling. Node-side rollup computation remains rejected outright.
- **Migration:** Replace the existing `SensorReading` in `app_builder` schema (greenfield, not extend — canon §1).

### 3.6 Regulated-action primitives (canon §32 NEW)
- **What:** E-signature, reason codes, immutable evidence artifacts, dedicated compliance hash-chain ledger separate from the platform audit chain.
- **New tables (schema `compliance` — new schema):** `electronic_signatures` (~13 cols, signer + re-auth method + payload hash); `reason_codes` (seeded per pack); `evidence_artifacts` (~15 cols: `id`, `collection_id`, `record_id`, `artifact_kind`, `storage_uri`, `s3_object_version_id` — immutable S3 object-lock version reference, `sha256` — content hash for tamper detection, `content_type`, `size_bytes`, `captured_at`, `captured_by`, `device_meta`, `audit_log_id`, **`retention_until timestamptz`** — object-lock retention boundary derived from regulatory class, **`legal_hold boolean default false`** — operational override that blocks expiration regardless of retention_until; together with hash + version_id these satisfy the Part 11 retention story, not just tamper detection); `signature_chains` (append-only, parallel to `audit_logs` chain, both linked via `audit_log_id`).
- **Re-auth methods:** leverages existing `MfaMethod`, `WebAuthnCredential`.
- **Linearization + Merkle batch root.** `signature_chains` ROOT inserts follow Plan Fix 41 — sequential single-row writes via `withAudit(...)`. Batching multiple actions under one signature is allowed via a **Merkle-tree batch root** with strict leaf shape: each leaf hash MUST be computed over the canonical tuple `(signer_user_id, signer_display_name_at_sign_time, signer_login_at_sign_time, signed_at_utc, action_code, target_collection_id, target_record_id, reason_code_id, signature_meaning, payload_hash)` — every Part 11 §11.50 metadata element AND a snapshot of the signer's identity at sign-time (display name + login may change later via §29.6 stamp bumps; the snapshot ensures the leaf can be replayed independently of subsequent user-record mutations). Compromise vs single-action linearization is acceptable because (a) the root signature chain-linearized, (b) every leaf cryptographically tied to the root, (c) UX cost of N sequential signs would lose the technician-experience win. `audit-bypass-check.ts` allows the Merkle-batch insert pattern with explicit code marker; raw batched `signature_chains` inserts without marker remain forbidden.
- **21 CFR Part 11 posture (hash chains are evidence mechanics, NOT compliance by themselves).** Part 11 compliance requires the platform deliver, beyond hash chains: (a) **validation evidence** — IQ/OQ/PQ-style change-control records mapping every signature-chain implementation change to its test, owned in `docs/validation/` with auditor-readable export; (b) **authority checks** — the signer's role + permission + active session must satisfy the action's required authority at sign-time (§28 evaluator + canon §29.6 stamp comparison enforced); (c) **operational checks** — sequence-dependent actions enforce predecessor completion (e.g., LOTO step-3 cannot sign before step-2 closed); (d) **audit retention** — 7-year minimum on `audit_logs` + `signature_chains` + `evidence_artifacts`; archive partitions never deleted (canon §34); (e) **record copying/export** — Compliance Officer can export any record's full signature-chain + audit-trail + evidence-artifact list as a single attestation file (PDF + JSON + S3 download manifest); (f) **signer identity binding** — Re-auth at sign-time via WebAuthn / TOTP / password-reverify per `signature_meaning`; weak meanings allow session-only, strong meanings require fresh credential; (g) **meaning of signature** — every signature carries a `signature_meaning varchar(64)` enum (`review`, `approval`, `responsibility`, `verification`, `closure`); leaf hash binds it; (h) **reason codes** — codified vocabulary per pack; never free-text; (i) **controlled session rules** — kiosk + collaborator + standard user sessions all have explicit idle-timeout policy + re-auth-on-resume policy per canon §29.

### 3.7 Mobile runtime parity (canon §33 NEW)
- **What:** Same `FormDefinition` / `WorkspacePage` JSON renders **semantically equivalent and validator-compatible** on web (React) and mobile (React Native): identical fields, identical actions, identical visibility rules, identical permission gates — with platform-native layouts per device (no attempt at pixel parity, which is the trap). Authored via `@hubblewave/ui-primitives` vocabulary: foundation (`Stack`, `Field`, `Card`, `List`, `ActionBar`, `Chart`, `Signature`), capture (`MediaCapture`, `BarcodeScanner`, `NameplateCamera`), and **field-tool primitives** designed for the technician's physical reality: `SwipeProgressCard` (horizontal swipe bound to state transitions — replaces precision tapping with glove-friendly gestures), `ThumbToggle` (full-row tap zone replacing tiny checkboxes), `LargeActionButton` (minimum 64dp tap target). Field-tool primitives exist because ServiceNow / Nuvolo treat mobile as a miniaturized desktop; HubbleWave treats mobile as a field tool. They degrade gracefully on web (swipe → drag, thumb-toggle → checkbox-with-larger-zone).
- **New packages:** `@hubblewave/ui-primitives` (vocabulary), `@hubblewave/ui-primitives-web` (MUI/Tailwind adapter), `@hubblewave/ui-primitives-mobile` (RN + Reanimated adapter).
- **New tables (schema `metadata`):** `mobile_sync_policies` (per-collection: `full | assigned_only | recent_only`, conflict strategy), `mobile_sync_conflicts` (operator-review queue).
- **Default conflict strategy:** `server_wins` for header fields + `last_write_wins` for completion fields (checklist answers, photos, notes). Per-collection override.
- **WatermelonDB schema** generated from collections marked `sync_to_mobile = true` on `CollectionDefinition` (new column).
- **"Elevator Mode" (offline-first as identity).** The mobile app NEVER blocks the technician on network state. Every action — open WO, swipe state, complete checklist, capture photo, e-sign, start next WO — is locally optimistic; UI responds in <16ms regardless of connectivity; WatermelonDB stores local state; background sync flushes silently on reconnect. UI surfaces an inline "Offline — working locally" badge, never a spinner. **Acceptance contract:** a technician can complete an entire shift in airplane mode (open, swipe through, sign, close every WO) and the sync replays on reconnect with conflict resolution per the policy above. Branded "Elevator Mode" because that's where Nuvolo dies — hospital MRI suites, sub-basements, elevators are exactly the dead zones competitors crumble in.

### 3.8 AVA Runtime UI Synthesis (canon §11 extension — powers "Invisible Manual")
- **What:** AVA can emit a **transient `FormDefinition` JSON** that renders via the same `@hubblewave/ui-primitives` vocabulary as persisted forms — without writing to metadata storage. Enables AVA to mutate the UI in response to a query: technician asks *"AVA, what does Error E-42 mean on a Baxter Sigma Spectrum?"* → AVA reads the ingested service manual, synthesizes a step-by-step troubleshooting checklist, renders it inline in the WO. ServiceNow / Nuvolo cannot do this — their AI is a side-panel that emits text, not a UI orchestrator.
- **No new tables.** Synthesis is request-scoped; the rendered form lives only for the user's session. Each call logs to `AVAProposal` for canon §12 traceability.
- **Validator gate:** AVA-emitted FormDefinitions pass the SAME validator that pack-shipped forms pass — only `@hubblewave/ui-primitives` vocabulary allowed, no escape hatches. Refused synthesis returns a structured "AVA can't render that" error to the orchestrator, never a runtime exception.
- **Trust progression:** Canon §12 per-feature. New synthesis features ship in Suggest mode (preview-before-apply); mature features may opt-in to direct render after evidence of accuracy.
- **Pack consumption:** Pack authors register AVA tool definitions via existing `AVATool` entity. The maintenance-core pack registers `synthesizeTroubleshootingChecklist(assetId, errorContext)`; AVA's planner selects it when the query matches a known asset + error-code shape.

### 3.9 Public Intake Primitive (canon §36 NEW — powers "Walk-by" nurse intake)
- **What:** Signed-token scoped public endpoints — unauthenticated POST that accepts narrow payloads, validates against a pack-declared schema, routes through AVA for triage, returns a confirmation token but NO platform data. Enables QR-code-on-asset + voice-memo intake without portal/login friction. ServiceNow / Nuvolo licensing + identity models make this expensive to retrofit.
- **New tables (schema `intake` — new schema):** `public_intake_tokens` (~10 cols: `id`, `code varchar(64) UNIQUE`, `scope_collection_id`, `scope_record_id`, `purpose varchar(64)`, `expires_at`, `max_uses int`, `uses int default 0`, `signing_kid`, `revoked_at`, `created_at`) — bound to a specific record (e.g., one asset) so a leaked QR cannot be used against other assets; `public_intake_submissions` (~12 cols: `id`, `token_id (FK)`, `raw_payload jsonb`, `structured_payload jsonb`, `ava_proposal_id (FK)`, `resolved_collection_id`, `resolved_record_id`, `ip_hash`, `ua_hash`, `outcome varchar(32)`, `created_at`).
- **Security posture (defense in depth):** Tokens signed via canon §29 KMS-backed signing (dedicated kid per instance). Per-token rate limit + per-IP rate limit + gitleaks-style secret scan on free-text. **Two-tier payload model:** (1) **JSON payload** for the submission body (max 50KB; schemas declared in pack manifest under `public_intake.schemas[]`); (2) **attachments** (audio, photos, PDFs) upload separately to pre-signed S3 URLs scoped to the token — each attachment max 25MB; each goes through AV scan + secret/PII scan + content-hash + **quarantine** before the AVA pipeline can read it; failed scan → attachment marked `quarantined`, AVA processing skips it, anomaly alert raised. JSON references attachments by their submission-scoped IDs. **Hard contract: endpoint never returns operational data** — only a submission code. Any data leak through this surface is a P0 incident.
- **Lifecycle + hardening (mandatory):** **Per-asset revoke/quarantine** — Maintenance Manager / Compliance Officer can revoke any QR token in one tap; quarantine an asset (all tokens revoked + future issuance refused) when abuse is detected. **Token rotation option** — pack-manifest declares whether tokens for a given purpose are lifetime or rotated on cadence (default lifetime for facilities-asset QR; rotate-quarterly available as a per-customer policy). **Replay idempotency** — every submission carries a client-generated UUID; duplicate UUIDs accepted with the same submission code (no duplicate WOs). **Anomaly alerts** — rate-limit breach, scan-fail, repeated malformed submissions on one token, geo-anomaly (token issued in NYC but submitted from offshore IP) all emit `RuntimeAnomaly` rows + page-on-call for the customer's ops contact.
- **Routing:** Submission lands in `intake.public_intake_submissions`; AVA pipeline (a worker job, no special privileges) reads the raw payload, runs structured extraction, writes back to `structured_payload` and `ava_proposal_id`, then dispatches to the pack-declared handler (e.g., maintenance-core's "create WO from intake" action) using a system-principal identity scoped to the intake purpose.
- **Service-boundary scanner:** `intake.*` writes restricted to `apps/api/src/app/intake/**` (token issuance) and `apps/worker/src/intake/**` (submission processing).

### 3.10 Break-Glass Field Override (canon §28.10 NEW — powers "Break-Glass PHI Access")
- **What:** Time-bound, audited override of §28 field masking — but **only for properties explicitly marked `break_glass_eligible = true` in metadata**, and **never** for properties classified into one of the hard-deny classes. A user with the right role + on an eligible property presses "Break Glass," selects a reason code, and the field is unmasked for a bounded duration (default 10 minutes). Auto-revoke after timer. ServiceNow ACLs cannot do dynamic, time-limited, audited, class-gated unmasking without custom scripting that breaks across upgrades.
- **Property eligibility metadata.** New column on `PropertyDefinition`: `break_glass_eligible boolean default false`. New column: `confidentiality_class varchar(64)` taking values from a seeded enum: `'public'`, `'internal'`, `'sensitive'`, `'never_reveal'`, `'legal_hold'`, `'sealed_investigation'`, `'system_secret'`, `'unrelated_patient_context'`. The latter five are **hard-deny classes** — break-glass NEVER unmasks them, regardless of grant or role. Pack authors mark each property with both flags at publish; validator refuses publish if `break_glass_eligible = true` AND `confidentiality_class` is a hard-deny class (the two are mutually exclusive).
- **New tables (schema `compliance`):** `field_unmask_grants` (~12 cols: `id`, `principal_user_id (FK)`, `collection_id`, `record_id`, `property_id`, `granted_at`, `granted_until`, `reason_code_id (FK)`, `signature_chain_id (FK)`, `audit_log_id (FK)`, `revoked_at`, `revocation_reason varchar(64)`).
- **Evaluator integration (canon §28.5 + §28.10) — three-stage:** (1) **Hard-deny check first.** If `PropertyDefinition.confidentiality_class` is in `{never_reveal, legal_hold, sealed_investigation, system_secret, unrelated_patient_context}` → DENY unconditionally. No grant overrides this. (2) **Active-grant check.** If property is `break_glass_eligible` AND an active unrevoked grant for `(principal, collection, record, property)` with `granted_until > now()` exists → UNMASK. (3) **Normal masking.** Run the canon §28.5 7-level matrix as usual. Grant lookup caches per-request in `UserRequestContext`; cache invalidation on grant insert/revoke via outbox event.
- **Audit linkage:** Every grant emits (a) a `signature_chains` row chained to the actor's session (compliance ledger), (b) an `audit_logs` row via `withAudit` (platform chain). Both linked via `audit_log_id` per canon §32. Tampering with a grant retroactively is impossible because the signature chain detects it.
- **Auto-revoke:** Worker job `compliance/break-glass-revoker.service.ts` polls `field_unmask_grants WHERE granted_until <= now() AND revoked_at IS NULL` every 60s; sets `revoked_at` + writes audit row. **Fail-safe in evaluator:** if `granted_until` is past, evaluator treats grant as revoked even before the steward stamps `revoked_at` — no time-window race.
- **Forensic query:** Compliance Officer workspace ships a "Break-glass log" view — every grant, every reason code, every principal, every patient context. Filterable by date / patient / user / property; CSV export.

### 3.11 External-Collaborator Session Tokens (canon §29 extension — powers Auditor Kiosk + Contractor Flow)
- **What:** Two complementary primitives for external (non-HubbleWave-account-holding) human users: (a) **read-only kiosk sessions** — time-bound scoped JWTs that bind a device to a single workspace with strictly-read-only permission (the Joint Commission auditor's iPad use case); (b) **magic-link collaborator invitations** — single-use email/SMS link that authenticates an external contractor into a session scoped to ONE record + a narrow permission set (view, attach photo, add notes, e-sign).
- **New tables (schema `identity`, near canon §29):** `kiosk_sessions` (~11 cols: `id`, `code varchar(64) UNIQUE`, `purpose varchar(64)` — e.g. `joint_commission_audit`, `workspace_id`, `bound_device_fingerprint`, `granted_by_user_id`, `granted_at`, `expires_at`, `revoked_at`, `signing_kid`, `audit_log_id`); `collaborator_invitations` (~13 cols: `id`, `code varchar(64) UNIQUE`, `email`, `phone`, `delivery_method`, `scope_collection_id`, `scope_record_id`, `permitted_actions text[]` — e.g. `['view', 'attach_photo', 'sign_closeout']`, `granted_by_user_id`, `granted_at`, `expires_at`, `consumed_at`, `signing_kid`).
- **Security posture:** Tokens signed by KMS (per canon §29.1) — dedicated kid per instance per purpose category. Read-only kiosk JWTs carry `aud='kiosk'`, `permitted_actions=['read']`, audience-checked at every API call; the §28 evaluator hard-rejects any write attempt under a kiosk audience regardless of role. Magic-link tokens carry `aud='collaborator'`, scope-bound; consumed_at stamped on first redemption (single-use). Per-device-fingerprint binding on kiosks prevents token-share. Every token issuance + redemption + revoke writes to `audit_logs` AND `signature_chains` (compliance officer can prove who handed an auditor what device when).
- **Revocation:** Compliance Officer / authorized role can revoke any kiosk session or magic-link in one tap; next API call → 401. Auto-revoke at `expires_at`. Token version bump on revoke prevents replay.
- **Service-boundary scanner:** `kiosk_sessions` + `collaborator_invitations` writes restricted to `apps/api/src/app/identity/external/**`. The kiosk audience handler in `JwtAuthGuard` (new branch alongside §29.7 service-token branch) writes `request.context = { kind: 'kiosk', sessionId, workspaceId, ... }`; consumers must narrow via `assertKioskContext()` helper.

### 3.12 Storage & Evidence Attachment Runtime (canon §38 NEW — shared substrate for marquees #5, #7, #9, #13, #15, #19, #29, #34)
- **What:** Generic pre-signed upload pipeline + immutable storage with object-lock + scanning + retention. Without this, packs reinvent attachment handling per surface (LOTO photos, evidence artifacts, contractor uploads, nameplate photos, asset-pin voice notes, invoice PDFs).
- **New tables (schema `storage`):** `attachment_uploads` (~12 cols: `id`, `purpose`, `scope_collection_id`, `scope_record_id`, `presigned_url`, `expected_size_bytes`, `actual_size_bytes`, `content_hash_sha256`, `s3_object_key`, `s3_version_id`, `status varchar(32)` ∈ {`presigned`, `uploaded`, `scanning`, `quarantined`, `clean`, `linked`}, `quarantine_reason`, `created_at`, `linked_artifact_id` FK→evidence_artifacts), `attachment_scan_results` (per-scan-pass: AV verdict, secret-scan verdict, PII verdict). Object-lock retention via S3 / equivalent — every upload carries `retention_until` + `legal_hold` flag.
- **Workers:** av-scan, secret-scan, content-hash, link-on-clean (transitions `status: clean → linked` and creates the `evidence_artifacts` row).
- **Service-boundary:** `storage.*` writes restricted to `apps/worker/src/storage/**` + `apps/api/src/app/storage/presign-controller.ts`. Consumers (packs) call `requestUpload(purpose, scope)` to get a presigned URL; never touch the storage tables directly.

### 3.13 Connector Runtime + Certified Simulators (canon §39 NEW — required by every integration adapter)
- **What:** Adapter SDK that every integration declares against, plus conformance-tested simulators for the §5.3 live-or-simulator rule. Without this, every pack's integrations are bespoke and the simulator certification claim is unfalsifiable.
- **Adapter SDK contract:** `IntegrationAdapter` TypeScript interface — `init(secret_handle, config)`, `healthCheck()`, `executeOperation(op_id, payload)`, `mode: 'live' | 'simulator'`, `conformance: ConformanceDeclaration[]`. Every adapter ships in two flavors (live + simulator); the simulator's conformance declares which operations it certifies (e.g., `hl7v2: ['ADT-A08', 'ORU-R01']`).
- **New tables (schema `integrations`):** `integration_adapter_registry` (per-instance enabled adapters with `mode` + `last_health_check_at`), `adapter_conformance_records` (per-adapter fixture-replay pass/fail history — gate-acceptance proof).
- **Pack publish:** pack manifest declares `integrations[]` with required adapter IDs + minimum conformance version. Install refuses if instance doesn't have a compatible adapter registered.

### 3.14 Semantic Search / Vector Match Primitive (canon §40 NEW — required by #2, #8, #11, #23, #29, #31, #33)
- **What:** Platform-level pgvector embedding index over pack-declared fields. Without this, packs would each wire their own vector search (Invisible Manual, Dirty Nameplate, Asset Pins, AVA Document AI for contracts/invoices, Semantic Recall, Auto-Commissioning all need it).
- **New tables (schema `search`):** `vector_index_entry` (partitioned by `collection_id` then by `embedding_model_version`; `(id, collection_id, record_id, embedding vector(768), source_text, source_field, last_indexed_at, model_version, provenance_jsonb)`), `embedding_model_registry` (which model is active per instance; supports rotation).
- **Pack opt-in:** `PropertyDefinition.vector_indexed = true` on text fields triggers indexing on write. Pack-manifest declares semantic-search use cases under `semantic_search.indexes[]`.
- **Query API:** `semanticMatch(query, collectionId, options)` returns ranked candidates with confidence + explainable factors (which embedding terms matched + which lexical fallback fired). Confidence bands (high > 0.85, med 0.70-0.85, low < 0.70) are platform defaults; packs declare per-use-case thresholds.

### 3.15 Spatial + Relationship Graph Primitive (canon §41 NEW — required by #12, #21, #22, #24, #32)
- **What:** Generic graph store + traversal API. Floor-plan routing (#12, #24), dependency graph (#22), Live Command Map (#21), and Analyzer Blast Radius (#32) all need graph operations. Without a shared primitive, each plugin would build its own graph.
- **New tables (schema `graph`):** `relationship_edge` (`id`, `src_collection_id`, `src_record_id`, `edge_kind`, `dst_collection_id`, `dst_record_id`, `weight`, `metadata_jsonb`; partitioned by `edge_kind`); `graph_index_hint` (per-collection indexing strategy for high-degree nodes).
- **Traversal API:** `traverse(start_node, edge_filter, depth_limit, options)` returns BFS/DFS results with cycle detection. `routeSolve(graph_id, from, to, weighting)` for floor-plan navigation. `blastRadius(start_node, edge_kind, depth, time_window)` for #32.
- **Pack-publish validator:** graphs declared in pack manifest checked for orphan nodes (door with no connected corridor) + cycle detection where forbidden (dependency graphs must be DAGs).

### 3.16 Financial Control Primitive (canon §42 NEW — required by #17, #27, #28, #29, #35)
- **What:** Approval-limit enforcement, separation-of-duties, three-way match, variance reason codes, budget hooks. Without this primitive, marquees #27 (capital), #28 (procurement), #29 (invoice), #35 (key custody co-sign) each reinvent financial controls.
- **New tables (schema `finance`):** `approval_limit_policy` (`(id, scope_kind, scope_ref, role, amount_min, amount_max, co_sign_roles[], active)`), `transaction_approval` (taskable — `(id, transaction_kind, transaction_ref, amount, requester_user_id, current_approver_role, status)`), `three_way_match_record` (`(id, po_id, invoice_id, receipt_id, variance_amount, variance_reason_code_id, matched_at)`), `budget_envelope` (`(id, cost_center, period_start, period_end, allocated_amount, consumed_amount)`), `variance_reason_code`.
- **Separation-of-duties:** the `transaction_approval` row's `requester_user_id` must differ from the approving user for transactions > threshold; enforced by the §28 evaluator + a dedicated `enforceSeparationOfDuties()` check at workflow transition.

### 3.17 Bulk Import / Commissioning Staging (canon §43 NEW — required by #33; reused by overlays for pack-data import)
- **What:** Generic staging table for bulk imports + AVA-normalized review grid + atomic publish. Marquee #33 Auto-Commissioning is the primary consumer, but every pack with seed data benefits.
- **New tables (schema `import`):** `import_batch` (taskable — `(id, purpose, source_filename, source_uploader_user_id, target_collection_id, row_count, status varchar(32)` ∈ {`ingested`, `normalizing`, `reviewable`, `publishing`, `published`, `rolled_back`}`, ava_confidence_summary_jsonb)`), `import_row` (per-row staging — `(id, batch_id, source_row_payload, ava_normalized_payload, ava_confidence_per_field, reviewer_overrides, status` ∈ {`pending`, `accepted`, `rejected`}`)`), `import_review_session` (reviewer assignment + completion timestamps).
- **Atomic publish:** transitioning `import_batch.status: reviewable → publishing → published` runs in a single DB transaction: all `import_row.status = accepted` rows insert into the target collection; audit chain extends; rollback is supported for N hours after publish (default 24h, customer-policy override).
- **Service-boundary:** `import.*` writes restricted to `apps/api/src/app/import/**`. Pack #33's `asset_import_batch` becomes a thin alias / view over the platform `import_batch` — the pack provides the asset-specific normalization rules but uses the platform staging machinery.

### 3.18 Integration Secrets + Egress Policy (canon §44 NEW — required by every integration adapter + critical for #26 NAC + #29 invoice + #30 telematics)
- **What:** Per-instance secret vault + outbound egress allowlist + kill switch. Without this, every adapter reinvents secrets handling, and NAC quarantine (#26) becomes a security vulnerability rather than a control.
- **New tables (schema `integrations`):** `integration_secret` (`(id, instance_id, adapter_id, secret_handle, kms_key_arn, encrypted_value bytea, rotated_at, expires_at)` — KMS-encrypted per canon §29 keys; never exposed to API process beyond a `getSecret(handle)` helper that resolves at call time), `egress_allowlist_entry` (`(adapter_id, target_host, target_port, target_protocol, purpose, active)` — deny-all default; explicit allowlist entries permit each outbound destination), `outbound_call_log` (every outbound HTTP/TCP call — partitioned monthly via pg_partman), `adapter_killswitch_state` (per-adapter emergency-stop flag; flips an adapter to fail-closed on every operation).
- **NAC guardrails (per #26):** the `nac-quarantine` adapter cannot fire a quarantine action without (a) dual-confirmation (security officer + maintenance manager), (b) customer-policy override flag, (c) an active `quarantine_safety_check_passed` evidence row written by an asset-criticality precheck — these gates prevent accidental clinical-operations impact.
- **Service-boundary:** secrets writes restricted to `apps/api/src/app/integrations/secrets/**`; egress allowlist + outbound_call_log restricted to `apps/worker/src/integrations/egress/**`.

### 3.19 Universal Customer Customization Override + Composition (canon §45 NEW — the customization-vs-upgrade moat across all 9 surfaces)

ServiceNow has 9+ customization layers (Business Rules, UI Policies, Client Scripts, Script Includes, UI Pages, UI Scripts, UI Macros, Workflows, Flow Designer), each with its own imperative customization API and no shared contract. Customizations accumulate across layers over 20 years; upgrades break across layers in unpredictable ways. HubbleWave has the same 9 layers BUT every customization across every layer follows ONE shared contract: metadata-only, customer-namespaced, version-declared, signature-chained, validator-classified. **§3.19 is the single primitive that makes that contract real.**

- **What:** One `metadata.customization_overrides` table with `target_kind` discriminator covering all 9 customization surfaces; per-surface adapter implementations apply load-time overrides to pack-shipped artifacts; pre-upgrade validator classifies every active override as green / yellow (auto-migrate) / red (block upgrade) across ALL surfaces in one pass. Pack authors mark artifacts with `customer_overridable: false | { kinds: [...] }` at publish time to declare platform invariants (audit emission, signature chain writes, security checks).
- **9 surfaces covered (target_kind enum):** `workflow`, `automation_rule`, `form_definition`, `view`, `workspace_page`, `property_validator`, `collection_access_rule`, `notification_template`, `ava_tool_config`.
- **5 override_kind enum values:** `skip` (disable artifact), `modify` (change specific fields), `replace` (substitute customer-namespaced artifact), `add` (inject customer-defined artifact), `remove` (delete; only on customer_overridable points).
- **New table (schema `metadata`):** `customization_overrides` (`(id, customer_id, target_kind, target_pack_id, target_artifact_id, override_kind, override_spec jsonb, target_platform_api_version, priority smallint, signature_chain_id, created_by_user_id, audit_log_id, is_active, created_at)`). Single table; per-surface adapters interpret `override_spec` per their schema. Customer-namespaced data referenced by `replace` / `add` overrides lives in `cust__{pack}__customizations__{surface}` tables per canon §17.5.
- **Override Merge Engine:** `UniversalOverrideMergeEngine.mergeForExecution(packArtifact, customerOverrides[])` applied at LOAD time when each surface's runtime instantiates a pack-shipped artifact. Deterministic ordering: priority asc, then created_at asc. Nesting depth capped at 3 to prevent override storms.
- **Pre-upgrade validator classifier:** for each active override at upgrade time, classify against the new pack version: **green** (target still exists with same identity), **yellow** (target renamed AND pack ships rename hint in migration manifest; auto-migrate), **red** (target removed OR override depends on signature/side-effect that changed; upgrade BLOCKED until customer reviews + re-targets). Validator runs in ONE pass across all 9 surfaces.
- **Pack-author override-eligibility declaration:** every pack-shipped workflow/automation_rule/form/etc. carries an `override_policy` declaration: `false` (platform-invariant; cannot be overridden by customer) OR `{ kinds: ['skip', 'modify', 'replace'], reason: 'documentation_string' }` (officially supported customization). The pack-validator at publish time refuses missing `override_policy` declarations on any pack-shipped artifact.
- **Audit trail:** every override creation/modification signed via §3.6 signature_chain with `signature_meaning='approval'`; override application at runtime emits an `audit_logs` row tagging the override_id active at the moment of execution (so the audit chain shows EXACTLY which overrides ran for a given record's lifecycle).
- **Acceptance contract (the customization-vs-upgrade moat):** Every active override across all 9 surfaces must classify green or yellow at upgrade time. Red overrides BLOCK the upgrade with structured error listing affected customers + remediation hints. The validator IS the upgrade gate, not an advisory.
- **Service-boundary:** `customization_overrides` writes restricted to `apps/api/src/app/customization/**`. Per-surface adapter implementations live alongside their surface's runtime (workflow override adapter in workflow runtime; form override adapter in form runtime; etc.). The merge engine + validator are in `apps/api/src/app/customization/` shared modules.
- **Why this matters for pitch:** without §3.19, "every workflow / form / automation rule is customizable without upgrade impact" is marketing. With §3.19, it's an architectural commitment with a bounded validator surface and a binding contract.

### 3.20 Generic Rounds + Observation Sessions (canon §46 NEW — rounds for anything, minimal-step creation, mobile-or-desktop completion)

- **What:** A platform-level rounds primitive that supports ad-hoc and scheduled execution against ANY target kind (asset, location, space, user, abstract checkpoint), with templates that any pack can ship, and a session model that writes results directly to the §3.5 observation substrate (flat, queryable; NO polymorphic assessment table). Generalizes maintenance-core's existing `work_round_definition` (currently asset-only per §14.1.1) into a substrate-level primitive that ANY pack reuses — clinical hygiene rounds, security walkthroughs, FCA inspection rounds, housekeeping rounds, PPE inventory rounds, compliance walkthroughs, etc.
- **New tables (schema `metadata` / `rounds`):** `round_definitions` (template — `(id, code, label, scope_pack_id, ordered_stops jsonb)` — where each stop has `{stop_id, target_kind, target_resolver_jsonb, observation_stream_template_id, response_kind, measurement_bounds_jsonb, required, prompt_text}`); `round_sessions` (the runtime session — extends existing `work_round_session` with `target_kind` enum + `creation_path varchar(16)` ∈ {ad_hoc, scheduled, template_clone}); `round_session_stops` (per-stop execution state with `observation_id` FK to the §3.5 observation row).
- **Polymorphic `stop_target_kind` enum:** `asset` (asset_id FK to maintenance-core asset OR cross-pack), `location` (location_id), `space` (space_id), `user` (user_id — for personnel checks), `abstract` (free-form string for non-physical checkpoints; e.g., "verify supply room 3 fully stocked"). Cross-pack target resolution via the asset_relationship graph (§3.15).
- **Minimal-step creation flows:**
  - **Ad-hoc (mobile):** 3 taps from home — Home → "Start Round" → pick template OR "Custom" → first stop card. For "Custom", tech adds stops on the fly via `<StopBuilder>` primitive (drag-to-add target + select observation_stream_template).
  - **Scheduled:** `round_definition.pm_schedule_id` (one new column linking to §3.3 scheduling primitives). When schedule fires, `RoundsGenerationProcessor` creates a `round_sessions` row + notifies assignee per the pack's assignment policy. Scheduled rounds are idempotent on `(round_definition_id, scheduled_at)`.
- **Minimal-step completion:** Reuses §14.1.6 `<RoundsRunner>` Glove-Mode swipe-deck (swipe-right=pass + observation row with verdict='pass' + auto-advance; swipe-left=fail + spawn reactive WO via auto rule 20; long-press=capture measurement). 50 stops complete in <60 seconds glove-on. Desktop variant: same primitive via §3.7 web adapter (drag-right replaces swipe-right).
- **Cross-pack reusability:** any pack (maintenance-core, clinical, facilities, ot-security, or future verticals) can ship `round_definitions` rows in pack manifest. Customer can clone + customize per canon §17.5 OR use pack's template as-is.
- **Service-boundary:** `round_definitions` writes restricted to pack installer + admin endpoint. `round_sessions` writes restricted to `RoundsSessionService`. `round_session_stops` writes restricted to `RoundsRunner` API + completion endpoint. Cross-pack: `round_sessions` for a clinical round CANNOT spawn maintenance-core work orders without going through canon §28 evaluator (cross-pack writes require explicit permission).

### 3.21 Platform Reporting Framework (canon §47 NEW — custom-aggregation builder + materialized views + scheduled exports + alerting; the "ServiceNow assessment_instance" anti-pattern killer)

- **What:** Cross-pack reporting substrate that powers rounds-results reports (§3.20 motivator), work-order analytics, compliance dashboards, inventory aging, vendor scorecards, and any other aggregation use case. ServiceNow's failure: assessment_instance + assessment_results + assessment_response polymorphic chain requires 3-5 table joins for ANY cross-question report; customers reinvent the same dashboards per use case. HubbleWave's answer: ONE reporting substrate that any pack consumes; observations are flat (§3.5); collection records are queryable directly; the reporting layer handles the rest.
- **New tables (schema `analytics`):** `report_definitions` (saved aggregations — `(id, code, label, scope_pack_id, source_collection_or_stream, group_by_fields[], aggregations[] {function, field, label}, filters_jsonb, materialization_policy enum, owner_user_id, signature_chain_id)`); `report_materialized_snapshots` (when `materialization_policy='snapshot'` — pre-computed result rows refreshed on schedule per the policy; `(report_id, snapshot_taken_at, row_data jsonb, ttl_until)`); `report_export_schedules` (CSV/PDF generation cron — `(report_id, format, frequency_rrule, recipient_user_ids[], delivery_method enum)`); `report_alert_rules` (threshold-based alerting — `(report_id, threshold_predicate_jsonb, alert_severity, notification_channels[], cooldown_seconds)`); `report_alert_events` (every fired alert; partitioned monthly).
- **Custom-aggregation builder (UI):** Visual builder for non-technical users to define reports. Drag source collection or observation_stream → drag fields to GROUP BY → drag fields to aggregate (COUNT / SUM / AVG / MIN / MAX / P50 / P95) → declare filters via §28-compatible row predicates → preview → save as `report_definitions` row. Builder ships as `<ReportBuilder>` plugin component. NO custom SQL required for 95% of use cases; SQL escape hatch available for admins via `report_definitions.custom_sql_override` (gated behind `analytics:report:sql_override` permission, dangerous=true).
- **Materialization policies:** Each report declares `materialization_policy ∈ {real_time, snapshot_5min, snapshot_hourly, snapshot_daily, snapshot_weekly, snapshot_on_demand}`. Worker maintains snapshots per policy via `ReportMaterializationProcessor` running pg materialized views OR snapshot tables (chosen by cardinality heuristic — pg matviews for ≤100k row aggregations; snapshot tables for higher). Refresh-on-write triggers for `real_time` reports (only allowed on small source collections).
- **Scheduled CSV/PDF exports:** Worker `ReportExportProcessor` generates output per `report_export_schedules` row; CSV via `csv-stringify`, PDF via `pdfkit` with auditor-readable layout. Outputs land in §3.12 evidence_artifacts with `retention_class` per pack policy; signed URLs via §3.11 collaborator session OR email delivery via NotificationService. Bundle attribution includes report definition snapshot, run_at timestamp, and signer identity for compliance audits.
- **Threshold-based alerting:** Each `report_alert_rules` row declares a threshold predicate on report output (e.g., "alert when bed-rail-check pass-rate < 0.80 in last 24h"). Worker `ReportAlertEvaluator` checks rules on every materialization tick; fires NotificationService when predicate matches; `cooldown_seconds` prevents alert storms; every fire writes `report_alert_events` row for forensic queries.
- **§28-aware aggregation safety:** Every report query runs under the requestor's `RequestContext` via canon §28 evaluator. Row-level masking applies BEFORE aggregation. Field-level masking applies AFTER aggregation (aggregations over masked fields are refused with structured error). K-anonymity threshold (default k=3) applied to grouped output where `confidentiality_class ≠ 'public'`. Reports with `recipient_user_ids[]` exports are pre-filtered to each recipient's authority — same report definition emits different data per recipient.
- **Service-boundary:** `report_definitions` writes restricted to `ReportDefinitionService` + UI Builder report-authoring path. `report_materialized_snapshots` writes restricted to `ReportMaterializationProcessor`. `report_export_schedules` writes restricted to `ReportExportSchedulingService`. `report_alert_rules` writes restricted to `ReportAlertRuleService`. `report_alert_events` writes restricted to `ReportAlertEvaluator`.
- **Why this matters for pitch:** ServiceNow's `assessment_*` polymorphic chain + Performance Analytics + reporting modules are 3 separate paid SKUs requiring custom report-builder work; HubbleWave ships ALL OF IT as ONE substrate that any pack reuses + any customer extends via `<ReportBuilder>`. "Show me every failed bed-rail check across all rounds this quarter, grouped by manufacturer" is a 30-second visual builder operation, not a 3-table join.

## 4. Pack Composition (4 packs, ~55 pack PRs)

### 4.1 `maintenance-core` (~25 PRs)
- **~51 collections** including: `asset` (with `asset_type` discriminator — supports vehicles per #30 via `asset_type = 'vehicle'` + telematics capability; supports keys per #35 via `asset_type = 'physical_key'` + key-custody capability), `asset_type`, `asset_relationship`, `asset_meter`, `asset_pin`, `location`, `location_relationship`, `space`, `maintenance_work_order` (taskable), `maintenance_work_task` (taskable), `pm_schedule` (supports utilization-triggered generation for mileage-based vehicle PM per #30), `pm_asset_assignment`, `maintenance_definition`, `checklist_template`, `checklist_instance`, `inspection`, `deficiency`, `work_round_definition`, **`work_round_session`** (NOT taskable; per #25), `vendor`, `vendor_contact`, `service_contract`, `warranty`, `master_service_agreement`, `purchase_order` (taskable), `vendor_scorecard`, **`procurement_proposal`** (taskable — AVA-drafted JIT shopping cart per #28; lifecycle proposed → reviewed → approved-to-PO → rejected; each line carries AVA's provenance: which upcoming PMs and historical-break-fix records justified the quantity), **`vendor_invoice`** (taskable — invoice PDF + extracted line items + reconciliation status per #29; lifecycle received → ai_reconciled → discrepancy_flagged → human_review → approved → paid), **`capital_replacement_request`** (taskable — generated by Active Intercept per #27 when repair-cost ÷ residual-value ratio exceeds policy; lifecycle proposed → director_review → approved → procurement_proposal_linked → asset_decommissioned), `parts_catalog`, `inventory_location`, `inventory_bin`, `inventory_lot`, `inventory_serial`, `mobile_inventory_holding`, `technician_presence`, `parts_requisition` (taskable), `parts_consumption`, `stock_movement`, `document`, `advisory`, `recall_response` (taskable + regulated), `dispatch_plan`, `dispatch_assignment`, `permit_to_work` (taskable + regulated), `loto_step_check` (regulated), `work_order_dependency`, **`asset_import_batch`** (taskable — per #33 Auto-Commissioning; lifecycle ingested → normalized → reviewed → published; tracks the spreadsheet ingest + AVA per-row normalization confidence + customer-confirmed publish), **`key_record`** (per #35 — physical key inventory: `(id, key_serial, key_class, parent_master_key_id, opens_locks[], status)`), **`key_assignment`** (taskable + regulated — per #35; every issuance e-signed via §3.6; signature_chain_id binds custody transfer), **`unrecovered_key_flag`** (taskable — auto-generated when an employee transitions to `terminated` while holding open key assignments).
- **~18 workflows** (process flows): WO intake/triage, **WO triage with entitlement intercept** (per #23), WO approval, PM generation orchestration, calibration signoff, recall remediation, FCA review, permit-to-work auth, parts reorder, AEM review, WO escalation loop, WO close-out, **round_completion_review** (per #25 — observation failures → reactive WOs), **contract_renewal_cycle** (T-90/30/7 notifications), **capital_replacement_review** (per #27 — Active Intercept fires → Maintenance Manager triages → Director approves or rejects → if approved, generates a linked `procurement_proposal`), **procurement_proposal_approval** (per #28 — AVA-drafted JIT cart → Procurement Manager Approve All / Edit / Skip → converts approved lines into `purchase_order` rows), **vendor_invoice_reconciliation** (per #29 — vendor PDF dropped at §3.11 portal → Document AI extract → cross-reference against time_on_site + MSA rates + parts_consumption → match → AP auto-approve, OR mismatch → discrepancy_review queue with reason codes), **fleet_telematics_to_pm** (per #30 — OBD2 mileage threshold → `pm_schedule` utilization-trigger → idempotent `maintenance_work_order`), **asset_import_commissioning** (per #33 — AVA-normalized spreadsheet → review grid → bulk publish), **key_revocation_on_termination** (per #35 — HR `user.status = terminated` event → automation fires → every open `key_assignment` for the user emits `unrecovered_key_flag` + recovery WO + Security Officer notification).
- **~25 automation rules** (state-machine guards, SLA start/stop, projection outbox, scheduled reorder check, scheduled warranty alerts, scheduled meter rollover, scheduled stale-WO escalation, before-delete reference check, after-insert checklist instantiation).
- **~50 views** across 7 personas.
- **9 OOTB workspaces** all built via UI Builder (the dog-food proof per canon §27):
  - `ws_technician_mobile_first` — Home / Work / **Rounds** (dedicated tab; `<RoundsRunner>` opens a `work_round_session` and presents the Glove-Mode Rapid Fire swipe-deck per #25; observations stream into §3.5; only failures spawn reactive WOs) / Assets; barcode → WO → checklist → photo → sign

- **5 workflows:** `fca_assessment_cycle`, `refrigerant_leak_response` (EPA reporting), `commissioning_signoff`, **`move_request_approval`** (originator → facility manager → IT (asset relocation) → safety officer → scheduled execution), **`space_reservation_conflict_resolution`** (concurrent booking detection → priority rule → notification + alternate-suggestion).
- **4 integrations:** `bacnet-building-pack` (richer than core), `autocad-dwg`, `ifc-bim`, **`wifi-beacon-occupancy`** (Wi-Fi controller + BLE beacon + badge-reader telemetry feed → §3.5 `observation_streams` → materialized into `occupancy_log`; per #24 Invisible Space Audits; aggregated by room + 5-min bucket, never per-individual).
- **7 plugins:** `<RefrigerantLedger>`, `<FcaDeficiencyMap>`, `<EnergyDashboard>`, `<SpaceReservationCalendar>`, `<MoveRequestBoard>`, `<OccupancyHeatmap>`, **`<LiveOperationalCanvas>`** (WebGL-native floor plan with real-time technician dots + AVA-plotted walking path for multi-PM shifts, per #24).

### 4.4 `ot-security-maintenance` overlay (~10 PRs) — Nuvolo OT Cyber Security parity
A third HubbleWave-owned overlay for hospitals + facilities tracking operational-technology (OT) device cyber-security alongside maintenance. Same pack model as Clinical / Facilities; same upgrade-safety contract.
- **~6 collections:** `ot_asset_vulnerability` (taskable — `(id, asset_id, cve_id, cvss_score, exploitability, exposure, status ∈ {open, mitigating, mitigated, accepted_risk}, signature_chain_id)`), `network_policy` (`(id, asset_id_set[], policy_kind, ingress_rules, egress_rules, last_audited_at, owner_user_id)`), `security_advisory` (`(id, source ∈ {claroty, medigate, asimily, ecri, fda, manufacturer}, ref_id, affected_asset_query, severity, published_at, action_required, status)`), `discovery_event` (asset-discovery feed — `(id, source_adapter, raw_payload, mapped_asset_id, status ∈ {new, mapped, ignored})`), `risk_score` (per-asset cyber-risk: `(asset_id, computed_at, score, factors_jsonb, computed_by_rule_set_version)`), `network_baseline` (allowed-traffic-pattern snapshot per asset class).
- **4 workflows:** `vulnerability_response` (open → triage → mitigation plan → e-sign → mitigated), `network_anomaly_review` (deviation from baseline → security officer review → policy update or quarantine), `security_advisory_distribution` (advisory ingest → asset-query match → notify owners → tracked acknowledgement), **`ava_convergence_routing`** (per #26 — OT alert + matching upcoming PM → propose attaching patch-install step to the PM; OT Security Officer one-tap approves; vulnerability ticket auto-closes-as-merged; signature_chains records the convergence decision).
- **5 integrations:** `claroty-medical-device-security`, `medigate-asset-feed`, `asimily-vulnerability-feed`, `generic-cmdb-export` (push HubbleWave asset registry to a customer-owned CMDB for cross-platform views), **`nac-quarantine`** (per #26 Quarantine Lockout — outbound API to NAC platforms like Cisco ISE / Aruba ClearPass / Forescout; on quarantine, the asset's `status` flips to `quarantined`, clinical mobile app surfaces "Do Not Use — Cybersecurity Quarantine" banner, signature_chains row recorded).
- **3 plugins:** `<OtAssetRiskMap>` (risk-colored floorplan overlay), `<VulnerabilityTracker>` (per-asset CVE board with remediation timeline), `<NetworkBaselineDashboard>` (deviation visualization).
- **1 new workspace:** `ws_ot_security_officer` (9th OOTB workspace) — vulnerability triage queue + advisory inbox + risk dashboard + per-asset baseline view; consumes `task_projection` for the vulnerability queue.

### 4.5 `regulated-action` capability (cross-cutting platform substrate, consumed by every pack)
The `regulated-action` capability is **provided by the platform substrate** (§3.6) — every pack consumes it via `requires_capabilities: ['regulated-action']` and binds collections via `capability_bindings.regulated_action`:
- **`maintenance-core` binds core regulated collections**: `permit_to_work`, `loto_step_check`, `recall_response`, `inspection`, `checklist_instance`, **`key_assignment`** (every key issuance e-signed by holder; master-key issuance requires supervisor co-sign per #35), **`capital_replacement_request`** (Capital Active Intercept per #27 — Director approval is a regulated action that forwards to Finance), **`vendor_invoice`** (variance approvals above customer-configurable threshold per #29 require AP-supervisor e-signature), **`procurement_proposal`** (Procurement Manager approval of AVA-drafted shopping cart per #28 — separation-of-duties enforced via §3.16).
- **`clinical-maintenance` binds overlay-owned regulated collections only**: `calibration_certificate`, `aem_program_membership`, `phi_disposal_record`.
- **`facilities-maintenance` binds overlay-owned regulated collections only**: `refrigerant_log`, `fca_assessment`, `commissioning_record`, `building_compliance_certificate`, `move_request` (cross-departmental moves with safety-officer approval).
- **`ot-security-maintenance` binds overlay-owned regulated collections**: `ot_asset_vulnerability` (accepted-risk decisions require OT Security Officer + Compliance Officer co-sign), `network_policy` (changes are regulated-action — every edit logged + reason-coded), `nac-quarantine` actions (per #26 — quarantine decisions are regulated actions with dual-confirmation captured in `signature_chains`).

Each pack binds only the collections it owns; overlays never re-bind maintenance-core collections. The validator refuses install of any pack whose `requires_capabilities` lists a capability the substrate version doesn't expose.

## 5. Full Showcase Pilot (~48-50 weeks — everything in scope)

This is no longer an MVP slice. The pilot is the full showcase: **35 differentiators** (#1-22 originals + #23-26 Contracts / Space / Rounds / OT Security category-resets + #27-30 Capital / JIT Procurement / Invoice Reconciliation / Fleet-as-Asset back-office reinventions + #31-35 Semantic Recall / Analyzer Blast Radius / Auto-Commissioning / Joint Commission Merkle Proof / Key Custody edge-reinventions), three overlays at production fidelity, complete substrate (18 platform sections), scale verification. Phase gates prevent a "giant final integration" risk — every 5-7 weeks ends with a demonstrable Go/No-Go increment. The RFP demo at week 50 is the customer-on-site moment; everything before it is internal acceptance. (Timeline grew from 46 → 50 weeks to absorb G0c shared substrate — §3.12-§3.18 are non-negotiable to prevent the packs from inventing ad-hoc versions of platform primitives.)

### 5.1 Pilot scope (Full Showcase — all features in scope)
- **All Phase 1 substrate** (canon §3.1-§3.11 — taskable, projection w/ circuit breaker + tombstones, scheduling, list-scale, observations, regulated-action w/ Merkle batch, mobile parity + Elevator Mode, AVA UI synthesis, public intake, break-glass override, external-collaborator session tokens). Active/archive partitioning included.
- **`maintenance-core` full:** all 38 collections (assets, asset-types, asset-relationships, asset-meters, asset-pins, locations, locations-relationships, spaces, work-orders, work-tasks, PM-schedules, PM-assignments, maintenance-definitions, checklists + instances, inspections, deficiencies, vendors + contacts + contracts + warranties, parts catalog + inventory locations + bins + lots + serials + mobile-inventory-holdings + technician-presence + requisitions + consumption + stock-movements, documents + advisories + recall-responses, dispatch plans + assignments + sprints, permits-to-work + LOTO step checks, work-order dependencies); all 8 OOTB workspaces; all 22 plugin components; all 12 workflows; all 25+ automation rules; all 6 integration adapters.
- **`clinical-maintenance` full:** all 12 collections, 3 workflows, 4 integrations (HL7v2, FHIR R4, ECRI feed, FDA UDI — live where customer credentials + sandbox environment are available, certified simulator otherwise per the §5.3 live-integration rule), 3 plugins. PHI masking + break-glass + AEM + recall response live.
- **`facilities-maintenance` full:** all 14 collections, 5 workflows, 3 integrations (BACnet building-pack adapter, AutoCAD DWG, IFC BIM — live where customer credentials + sandbox environment are available, certified simulator otherwise per the §5.3 live-integration rule), 6 plugins. FCA + refrigerant + commissioning + space reservations + move-request + occupancy tracking all live.
- **`ot-security-maintenance` full:** all 6 collections, 3 workflows, 4 integrations (Claroty, Medigate, Asimily, generic-CMDB-export — live or certified-simulator per §5.3 rule), 3 plugins, 9th OOTB workspace `ws_ot_security_officer`. Vulnerability response + network-anomaly review + security-advisory distribution all live.
- **AI marquee #1 — Voice WO capture + AVA structuring.** Technician taps mic, says *"Infusion pump 4521 in room 312 is alarming and the screen is frozen, replaced battery yesterday."* AVA produces a WO with asset linked (UDI match on "4521"), location linked (room 312), category (display/alarm), description structured, suggested triage. One-tap submit. Single canon §12 Suggest-mode flow.
- **AI marquee #2 — "Invisible Manual" (AVA-native troubleshooting).** Technician opens a WO on mobile, taps mic, asks *"AVA, what does Error Code E-42 mean on a Baxter Sigma Spectrum?"* AVA — having ingested the asset's PDF service manual via document AI (canon §11) — doesn't just answer in text; it **dynamically synthesizes a step-by-step troubleshooting checklist that renders inline in the mobile UI** via the `<ChecklistRunner>` primitive. Technician steps through it; AVA logs each step's outcome. Checklist is ephemeral — never persisted as a metadata `checklist_template`. Powered by §3.8 AVA Runtime UI Synthesis + canon §11 document AI + canon §33 mobile parity, composed. **ServiceNow / Nuvolo cannot do this** — their AI is a side-panel that emits text, not a UI orchestrator that can generate runtime components.
- **AI marquee #3 — "Walk-by" frictionless nurse intake.** Nurse scans the QR code on an infusion pump with their phone. **No login, no portal, no required fields.** They hold a button, say *"The screen is frozen and it keeps beeping,"* and walk away. AVA (a) resolves the asset from the signed QR slug, (b) processes the audio, (c) categorizes the issue, (d) sets priority based on asset criticality + life-support designation (clinical overlay), (e) routes to the correct biomed group. Nurse gets one confirmation toast; the technician sees the structured WO in their workspace within projection lag. Powered by §3.9 Public Intake Primitive. **ServiceNow / Nuvolo cannot do this** without enterprise license + custom portal work — their licensing + identity models make frictionless guest ingest expensive.
- **AI marquee #4 — Deterministic parts staging (rules + history, not predictive ML).** When AVA structures the WO (from voice capture or QR intake), a deterministic rules engine queries the asset's WO history + parts-consumption ledger + error-symptom keyword index. The engine ranks candidates by (frequency-of-use on this asset class) × (recency) × (parts cross-reference match strength). Top candidate, if confidence-rule passes, is reserved via `parts_requisition` insert + stockroom push notification. **Technician sees "Part reserved in Bin B4" on their mobile BEFORE they leave their desk.** Every reservation carries full provenance — clicking the suggestion shows the ranking factors and the 3 historical WOs that drove it. No black-box ML; no per-customer training. Trained ML refinement is a **post-G6** option that strictly improves accuracy on top of the same explainable substrate. **ServiceNow / Nuvolo cannot do this at intake time** — it requires tight synchronous coupling between the reasoning layer and inventory collections, which their architecture decouples by design.
- **AI marquee #5 — "Break-Glass" PHI access.** WO carries a `patient_context` field masked by default (HIPAA minimum-necessary per canon §28.5). Tech presses "Break Glass," selects a reason code (Emergency Repair, Equipment Triage, Infectious Isolation Check), and the patient context (e.g., *"Airborne Isolation — N95 Required, Room 312 — VRE precautions"*) is revealed for **10 minutes**. Auto-revoke. Every grant + reveal recorded in immutable `signature_chains` ledger; HIPAA auditor can query "every break-glass on patient X in the last 6 months" in one click. Powered by §3.10 Break-Glass Field Override. **ServiceNow / Nuvolo cannot do this** without custom scripting that breaks across upgrades — their ACLs are static; dynamic, time-limited, audited field unmasking is not native; the 20M-row task table makes the row-security overhead prohibitive.
- **Technician superpower #6 — Glove-Mode swipe UX.** Mobile WO list and detail use `<SwipeProgressCard>` — swipe right = start, left = block/escalate, long-swipe right = complete. `<ThumbToggle>` replaces every checklist checkbox with a full-row tap zone. `<LargeActionButton>` enforces 64dp minimum tap targets. Designed for nitrile gloves + one-handed ladder use. Works the same on web (drag) and mobile (swipe). ServiceNow's mobile is a miniaturized desktop; ours is a field tool. Eliminates the "precision tapping on tiny dropdowns" pain that infuriates Nuvolo users.
- **Technician superpower #7 — Generative close-out (eliminate typing).** At WO end, tech taps mic and says *"Swapped the intake O-ring, recalibrated pressure to 50 PSI, ran a test cycle, all good."* AVA renders this into a compliance-grade close-out: FDA-style resolution narrative, auto-selected reason codes from the regulated-action vocabulary (`corrective_action_taken`, `calibration_verified`), populated parts-consumption log, pre-filled resolution fields. Tech reviews on a `<SwipeProgressCard>`, swipes-right-to-approve, e-signs via Plan-Fix-41 chain (or Merkle batch if closing N WOs at end-of-shift). Turns a 3-minute typing chore into a 5-second voice memo while raising audit quality. Powered by §3.8 AVA UI synthesis + canon §11 voice + §3.6 regulated-action.
- **Technician superpower #8 — Dirty Nameplate Vision Extraction.** Tech snaps a photo of a scratched, dusty, dim asset nameplate via new `<NameplateCamera>` primitive. AVA Vision OCRs the text, fuzzy-matches against `task_projection` + asset registry, returns the asset with confidence score. Confidence > 90% → opens asset detail directly; 70-90% → surfaces top-3 candidates for tap-confirm; < 70% → falls back to `<BarcodeScanner>` or manual search. **The barcode-missing failure mode kills Nuvolo customers** in the field; Dirty Nameplate is the answer.
- **Technician superpower #9 — Elevator Mode (offline as identity).** Every mobile action is locally optimistic with <16ms UI response. WatermelonDB stores local state; sync flushes silently on reconnect. Tech can complete an entire shift in airplane mode — open WO, swipe state, complete checklist, capture nameplate photo, voice close-out, e-sign — all without seeing a spinner. Inline "Offline" badge instead of blocking. Implementation in §3.7; branded prominently for the RFP because **speed is the #1 complaint against Nuvolo**.
- **Connected-network superpower #10 — Peer-to-peer parts locator.** Tech taps "Find Part" on a WO. AVA queries `inventory_location` (stockrooms + bins) AND `mobile_inventory_holding` (every clocked-in technician's cart/van stock) AND `technician_presence` (who's near and available). Returns ranked candidates: *"John Smith is on Floor 2 and has 3 of these in his cart."* Tap → ping John via in-app notification: *"Can I grab one of your batteries for WO-1042?"* John accepts/declines on his phone; on accept, `parts_requisition` is created with `source = peer_transfer` and `holder_user_id = john`. Treats inventory as a dynamic mobile network, not a static warehouse. **Privacy gate:** `technician_presence` is opt-in per-technician policy with explicit consent recorded; presence visibility scoped to maintenance team peers only.
- **Connected-network superpower #11 — "Tribal Knowledge" Asset Pins.** A 30-year veteran taps the mic on an asset record and says *"Hey guys, the manual says X, but just jiggle the bypass valve first before resetting."* AVA transcribes, indexes, tags severity, and stores in `asset_pin`. When a junior tech later scans that same asset (Dirty Nameplate or QR), AVA proactively surfaces: *"3 technicians have noted a quirk with this valve — tap to hear."* The veteran's voice plays back at 1×, optionally with the AVA-summarized transcript. Captures institutional memory at zero friction — converts watercooler talk into searchable asset intelligence. Solves the "veteran retires, knowledge lost" problem that breaks every legacy CMMS.
- **Connected-network superpower #12 — Contextual Floor-Plan Routing (the "Blue Dot" experience).** WO says *"Location: West Wing, Floor 3, Utility Closet 3B, Panel 4."* Tech taps "Take me to Asset" in the `<FloorPlanRouter>` plugin. The facilities overlay's `cad_drawing_link` / `ifc_space_link` graph yields an interactive floor plan with a highlighted path from the tech's current position to the target door — Google-Maps-style indoor navigation. Nuvolo's space module is heavy and desktop-leaning; this is fluid + mobile-first + offline-cached.
- **Connected-network superpower #13 — Smart LOTO with AVA Vision.** When a WO carries a `permit_to_work` for hazardous-energy work, `<LotoStepRunner>` enforces the **customer-defined energy-control procedure under OSHA 1910.147 (Lockout/Tagout)** as authored in the pack metadata. **Tech must snap a photo of each placed lock**; AVA Vision confirms a lock is present in the image (lock-type matching the expected type for the step) before the tech can swipe to the next step. Each verified step writes a `loto_step_check` row chained into `signature_chains` — the entire procedure becomes mathematically auditable evidence rather than a paper-binder headache. Safety officers will champion HubbleWave on this one feature alone. **Vision-failure policy:** confidence < 70% → step BLOCKED with structured error "AVA cannot confirm lock placement; retake photo or escalate to safety officer."
- **Systemic differentiator #14 — Auditor Kiosk (Compliance Officer / Joint Commission, FDA).** When an auditor walks in, the Compliance Officer issues a §3.11 kiosk session bound to the auditor's iPad, hands them the device. The iPad lands on `ws_auditor_kiosk`: PM compliance %, drill-downs into critical life-safety assets, direct access to the immutable `signature_chains` ledger with full filterability, CSV/PDF export. No edit affordance anywhere — every API call enforces `kind='kiosk'` audience read-only. Compliance Officer can revoke the session in one tap when the audit ends. Hands an auditor mathematically verifiable evidence rather than printed PDFs and apologies. **ServiceNow / Nuvolo cannot do this** without manual prep work + custom report-builder time + heroic dashboard hacks.
- **Systemic differentiator #15 — Zero-Login Contractor Flow (External Vendor).** When a WO is routed to an external vendor (elevator company, specialized imaging tech, etc.), HubbleWave sends a §3.11 magic-link via SMS + email. Vendor taps the link → lightweight mobile web view (`<ContractorPortal>`) loads → sees the WO, the asset, the location, attaches photo, types or voice-dictates close-out notes, e-signs. **No app download, no password, no training, no per-seat license.** Brings 100% of contractor work into the platform's audit trail. **ServiceNow / Nuvolo charge per-seat for external users** — making this expensive enough that most hospitals manage contractor WOs via email and lose all visibility.
- **Systemic differentiator #16 — Smart Sprint Batching (rule-based clustering, not AI optimizer).** Dispatcher gets AVA-proposed Sprints built by a **deterministic clustering algorithm**: (a) cluster open WOs by floor + wing locality from `task_projection`; (b) overlay `pm_schedule` PMs due in the next 14 days that share locality and skill; (c) intersect with `technician_presence` + skill matrix; (d) score by total estimated time vs trips-saved factor. Returns proposals like *"Sarah, 4 WOs for your morning: 3 reactive on Floor 4 + 1 HVAC PM due next week on the same floor. Estimated 95 minutes, two trips saved."* Each Sprint card shows the clustering criteria + scoring weights — auditable, deterministic, no black-box. Dispatcher reviews on `<SprintBoard>` and one-tap approves; Sprint is never auto-applied. ServiceNow's routing is a map; ours is an explainable scheduler. Post-G6 option: trained ML model refines the locality + scoring weights from historical Sprint-acceptance data.
- **Systemic differentiator #17 — Repair-vs-Replace Score (deterministic rubric + transparent sentiment, not black-box ML).** Every asset carries a **Replacement Urgency Score** computed by a transparent published rubric: quantitative (cumulative repair cost ÷ replacement cost, downtime hours, MTBF trend, warranty remaining — each weighted by a published coefficient) PLUS qualitative signal from close-out narratives + asset pins (sentiment classified by a deterministic keyword + phrase lexicon shipped with the pack — every classification shows which lexicon entries fired). When techs log *"this thing is a nightmare"* or *"patched it again but the motor is dying,"* the lexicon picks it up with provenance. Score surfaces on `<ReplacementUrgencyScore>` plugin. **Every score is explainable end-to-end** — click any score, see exactly which factors contributed and how much. Maintenance Manager sign-off required before score forwards to Finance dashboard. Post-G6 option: trained ML model improves sentiment classification accuracy while keeping the published-rubric structure unchanged. **CFO/Finance Director sees an explainable financial-decision tool**, not a black box. ServiceNow / Nuvolo treat this as a separate "asset analytics" SKU; we ship it core, deterministic, and explainable.
- **WO-processing view #18 — Pivot-Kanban (contextual boards).** Dispatcher's Kanban with pivotable columns: state (default) / floor / technician skill / asset category / priority. One tap pivots the view. Drag-between-columns isn't just visual — it executes AVA macros: drag a WO into "Electrical" → AVA re-assigns to the nearest available electrician + updates categorization + writes audit row. ServiceNow's VTB groups only by state. This is the same data, pivoted in real-time, with drag-as-command semantics.
- **WO-processing view #19 — Dual-Axis Timeline (Asset vs Technician sync).** Specialized Gantt with two synchronized horizontal tracks: technicians on top (shifts, current WOs), critical assets on bottom (their "available for maintenance" windows pulled from EHR scheduling — Clinical overlay only — or facilities calendars). Dispatcher drags a 4-hour PM block; as they drag, AVA highlights valid technician × asset-window intersections in green; release snaps to the chosen intersection. Eliminates "playing Tetris with spreadsheets" — the operating-room PM scheduling pain point.
- **WO-processing view #20 — Triage Deck (high-speed keyboard dispatch).** Inspired by Superhuman email. Incoming unassigned WOs presented one-at-a-time as a massive central card showing photo, nurse's voice transcript, AVA's suggested tech with reasoning, asset criticality. Keyboard-driven: Right Arrow = accept AVA's suggestion → next card; Left Arrow = reject / request more info; Up Arrow = escalate to critical; Down Arrow = defer to backlog; Number keys = override with specific technician. Dispatcher clears 50 tickets in 2 minutes without touching the mouse. ServiceNow's list view requires multi-click on every row.
- **WO-processing view #21 — Live Command Map (spatial god-mode).** Top-down 2D floorplan / campus map; WOs render as heat-map dots colored by priority (red critical, yellow routine, blue informational); technicians render as moving blue dots from `technician_presence` (with privacy opt-in). Maintenance Manager sees the spatial reality immediately: 15 red dots clustered on Floor 3 = burst pipe cascading into electrical shorts. Lasso-select the cluster, drag onto the nearest technician's blue dot = creates a "Major Incident" batch assignment with one gesture. ServiceNow's map module is a heavy add-on; this is the platform's default view for an instance with `cad_drawing_link` / `ifc_space_link` data.
- **WO-processing view #22 — Dependency Graph (bottleneck hunting).** Complex repairs have inter-trade dependencies (Carpentry opens wall → Plumbing fixes pipe → Electrical re-wires). Graph view: WOs as bubbles, dependencies as arrows. AVA computes the critical path and badges the bottleneck WO in glowing red: *"This $15 drywall repair is currently blocking 3 high-priority plumbing tasks."* Shifts maintenance management from reactive ticketing to proactive bottleneck elimination. Powered by a `work_order_dependency` join collection (~5 cols: `id, blocker_wo_id, blocked_wo_id, dependency_kind, created_by`) added to maintenance-core.
- **Category-reset #23 — Active Entitlement Shield (reinvents Contracts).** Nuvolo / ServiceNow ship Contracts as static data-entry forms; technicians do work, then billing realizes the asset was under warranty — millions in "warranty leakage." HubbleWave inverts this: (a) **AVA Document AI intake** — drag a 50-page vendor PDF onto `master_service_agreement`; AVA (canon §11) extracts SLAs + covered components + response-time clauses + exclusion lists into structured metadata, never manual data entry; (b) **Contextual Dispatch Intercept** — at WO triage, AVA checks `master_service_agreement` + `warranty` against the asset; if covered, the dispatcher sees an inline prompt *"This MRI is under a Gold Philips warranty (response 4h, parts + labor covered) — route to Philips via their vendor portal?"*; one tap routes the WO out via §3.11 Zero-Login Contractor magic-link (vendor receives SMS, performs work, captures photo, e-signs — no vendor portal login). Powered by §3.8 AVA UI synthesis + canon §11 document AI + §3.11 collaborator sessions, composed. Eliminates warranty leakage as a category.
- **Category-reset #24 — Live Operational Canvas (reinvents Space Management).** Nuvolo treats space as an office-planner tool disconnected from the technician walking the floor. HubbleWave makes it a live operational canvas: (a) Floor plans render natively in mobile via WebGL (`<FloorPlanRouter>` from #12 + new `<LiveOperationalCanvas>` plugin); when a tech has 8 PMs on Floor 3, AVA plots the most efficient walking path between rooms (TSP-approx solver against the floor-plan graph) + estimates total time saved; (b) **Invisible Space Audits** — instead of dispatching humans for "space utilization studies," HubbleWave ingests Wi-Fi / Bluetooth beacon / badge-reader telemetry via the §3.5 observations substrate (new adapter `wifi-beacon-occupancy`); the worker materializes per-room occupancy heatmaps into `occupancy_log` automatically; space metadata reflects actual usage, not planner assumptions. Privacy gate: occupancy is aggregated by room + 5-min bucket, never per-individual; opt-in per customer with explicit policy disclosure to staff.
- **Category-reset #25 — Continuous Observations Engine (reinvents Rounds).** Nuvolo / ServiceNow check 50 fire extinguishers → spawn 50 task rows → bloat the polymorphic task table → technician taps "Close Complete" 50 times. **HubbleWave: a round is not a task; it is a Batch Observation Session.** `work_round_session` (NOT taskable) opens on the mobile app; each check writes a single `observations` row (pass / fail / measurement) into the §3.5 partitioned table — 50 checks = 50 observations, 0 WO rows. **Glove-Mode Rapid Fire** swipe-deck UX: tech swipes right = "Pass" + auto-advance to next check; left = "Fail" + spawn ONE reactive `maintenance_work_order` (taskable) only for the failure; long-press = capture measurement value. 49 passes complete in seconds. **Dynamic Smart Rounds**: AVA analyzes failure trends across `observations` rollups — if brand-X beds are failing bed-rail checks across the hospital this week, AVA dynamically injects a mandatory bed-rail check into the standard room-round for that day's techs. The polymorphic-task bloat that kills ServiceNow at scale never happens.
- **Category-reset #26 — Network-to-Physical Triage (reinvents OT Security).** Nuvolo / ServiceNow ingest Medigate/Ordr alerts and create an avalanche of security incident tickets. HubbleWave converges the digital + physical paths: (a) **AVA Convergence Routing** — when an OT alert fires (*"Infusion pump 4521 needs OS patch CVE-2026-1234"*), AVA cross-references the asset's physical maintenance schedule. If a PM is already scheduled for next Tuesday, AVA suggests *"Attach the patch-install step to the existing PM instead of dispatching a separate ticket today? Saves a trip, satisfies the SLA window."* OT Security Officer one-tap approves; the PM WO gets a new checklist step + the vulnerability ticket auto-closes-as-merged. (b) **Quarantine Lockout** — if a device is actively compromised (CVE with known exploit + observed-exfil signature), an automation rule fires an outbound API call to the NAC (Network Access Control — new adapter `nac-quarantine`) to drop the device from the network; simultaneously the asset's `status` flips to `quarantined` and the clinical mobile app surfaces a *"Do Not Use — Cybersecurity Quarantine"* banner over the asset. All actions chain into `signature_chains` for forensic audit. Powered by §3.6 regulated-action + §3.5 observations + the new `nac-quarantine` integration adapter.
- **Back-office reinvention #27 — Predictive TCO (Capital Planning that beats accounting ledgers).** Nuvolo / ServiceNow track financial lifecycle as static depreciation tables. HubbleWave makes TCO **live**: AVA continuously computes `replacement_urgency_score` (already in #17) AND a new `capital_replacement_request` recommendation. The deterministic rubric: cumulative repair cost ÷ replacement cost (with straight-line depreciation residual value as denominator), MTBF trend, downtime hours, warranty remaining, sentiment from close-out narratives. **Active intercept at parts-order time**: when a technician tries to order a $4,000 controller board for a 10-year-old ultrasound, AVA inspects the asset's residual value + recent repair spend; if repair-cost ÷ remaining-residual-value > customer-policy threshold (default 60%), the order dialog interrupts: *"This repair is $4,000; remaining residual value is $6,200 (TCO ratio 65%). Want me to generate a Capital Replacement Request to the Director instead?"* One tap → `capital_replacement_request` row + Maintenance Manager notification → forwards to Finance Director per #17 forwarding policy. ServiceNow's ledger never interrupts; HubbleWave makes the financial decision visible at the operational moment.
- **Back-office reinvention #28 — Autonomous JIT Procurement (parts you'll need next month, not parts that hit zero).** Nuvolo / ServiceNow reorder on min/max thresholds — purely reactive. HubbleWave is proactive: AVA reads the next 30-90 days of `pm_schedule` + historical break-fix consumption rates from `parts_consumption` + asset-class failure trends + supplier lead times. It drafts `procurement_proposal` records (essentially AVA-pre-filled `purchase_order` shopping carts grouped by vendor) and hands them to the Procurement Manager as *"Approve All / Edit / Skip"* on `<ProcurementProposalCart>`. The proposals carry full provenance — clicking a line item shows which PMs and historical failures drove the quantity. Each approval transitions the proposal into actual `purchase_order` rows with `source = ava_jit_proposal`. The "stock hit zero, emergency reorder, PM slipped" Nuvolo failure mode disappears.
- **Back-office reinvention #29 — AI-Enforced Vendor Invoice Reconciliation.** Vendors email PDF invoices; humans manually check that billed hours match WO time logs and rates match contracts. HubbleWave: vendor uses the §3.11 magic-link contractor portal to drop the PDF; new `vendor_invoice` collection (taskable) ingests it; AVA Document AI (canon §11) extracts billed-hours + line-items + rates; cross-references against (a) the WO's actual `time_on_site` (computed from `technician_presence` clock-in/out + GPS-fix-on-mobile when the magic-link was redeemed), (b) the structured `master_service_agreement` rates extracted at intake (per #23), (c) the WO's `parts_consumption` ledger. Any mismatch flags `invoice_discrepancy` and routes to `invoice_discrepancy_review` workflow before it reaches AP. AP sees only invoices that have already been reconciled or explicitly approved-with-variance — they stop being the bottleneck. Every check + every override is `signature_chains`-audited.
- **Back-office reinvention #30 — Fleet-as-Asset (the "asset is an asset" architecture proof).** Nuvolo / ServiceNow ship Fleet Management as a disconnected separate module with its own UI and data model. HubbleWave's answer: **vehicles are just `asset` rows with `asset_type = 'vehicle'` and a `telematics` capability binding to §3.5 observation streams**. New integration adapter `obd2-telematics-feed` ingests OBD2 + GPS telemetry into `observation_streams` (subject_collection_id=asset, subject_record_id=vehicle.id, stream_kind ∈ {engine_rpm, coolant_temp, mileage, gps_lat, gps_lon, fault_code}). All of maintenance-core's WO + PM + parts + dispatch + visualization views apply unchanged: a fire-rescue truck PM is the same WO type as an MRI PM. Mileage-based PM (oil change every 5000 mi) fires automatically via §3.3 scheduling utilization-triggered generation. Fault codes via OBD2 stream into `observations`; threshold-rule fires a reactive `maintenance_work_order` with the AVA-suggested fix (per #4 Predictive Parts Staging). Zero new tables, zero new UI patterns — proves the §17.5 customization-contract claim that the platform is universal.
- **Edge reinvention #31 — Semantic Recall Quarantine (FDA / ECRI recalls).** Nuvolo / ServiceNow do dumb text-matching against the asset registry; messy hospital data (typos, model-number variants, manufacturer rebrandings) means recalls miss matches and humans manually reconcile. HubbleWave: AVA reads the raw recall notice and uses **vector-search semantic similarity** (canon §11) against asset metadata; *"Philips Model X"* matches assets entered as "Philps Mod-X", "Phillips M-X", or "Philips MX-2026" with confidence scores. Confidence > 0.85 → auto-tag all matching assets with "Do Not Use — Active Recall" on the clinical mobile app + auto-generate `recall_response` taskable rows + auto-dispatch to biomed group; 0.70-0.85 → surface for biomed-engineer one-tap-confirm; below 0.70 → notification only. The 14 affected patient monitors that Nuvolo would miss are caught in seconds. Backed by existing `recall_response` (clinical overlay) + new `<SemanticRecallMatchBoard>` plugin.
- **Edge reinvention #32 — Graph-Native Reverse Calibration Traceability ("Analyzer Blast Radius").** A Fluke Analyzer goes out of tolerance during its own calibration check. Every patient monitor it touched in the last 6 months potentially has bad calibration. Nuvolo / ServiceNow report-builders make this nightmarish; HubbleWave's observation substrate makes it a one-click query. Every calibration event already writes an `inspection` row (clinical overlay regulated-action) AND an `observations` row (instrument + asset + reading + signed measurement). One click on the faulty Fluke's asset detail → AVA runs a graph traversal: *"Show me every asset where the inspection.calibration_instrument_id = this Fluke in the last 180 days."* Returns 500 patient monitors. Bulk action: suspend clinical status → `<DoNotUseBanner>` lights up on each asset in the mobile app → reactive `maintenance_work_order` (re-calibrate) auto-generated for each. Compliance officer's worst nightmare becomes a 30-second query. New plugin: `<AnalyzerBlastRadiusBoard>` in `ws_biomed_engineer`.
- **Edge reinvention #33 — AVA Auto-Commissioning (Capital Project Handover).** A construction contractor finishes a hospital wing and hands the facilities team a messy 5,000-row Excel: HVACs, doors, lights, infusion pumps. Nuvolo / ServiceNow customers spend 6 months on manual data entry. HubbleWave: facilities manager drag-drops the spreadsheet into `<AssetImportWizard>`; AVA (canon §11 document AI + the metadata vocabulary) normalizes naming conventions, categorizes assets to existing `asset_type` taxonomy, infers `location` mappings from column heuristics, structures everything into a draft `asset_import_batch` (taskable, lifecycle: ingested → normalized → reviewed → published). Facilities manager reviews on a structured grid + AVA explanations + per-row confidence; one-tap accept-all (or edit-then-accept) publishes all 5,000 assets in minutes. The 6-month commissioning lag disappears. New collection: `asset_import_batch`; new plugin: `<AssetImportWizard>`; new workflow: `asset_import_commissioning`.
- **Edge reinvention #34 — Joint Commission EoC Auditor Proof (extension of #14).** The Auditor Kiosk (`ws_auditor_kiosk` + §3.11 kiosk session) gets a Live Operational Canvas mode for the Joint Commission Environment-of-Care audit. Auditor taps any room on the Live Command Map; the workspace shows: every PM done in that room in the audit window, every inspection (including fire-doors, life-safety devices, sprinklers), with the **Merkle root hash** from `signature_chains` for each. Tap a fire-door → see the signed inspection row → see the Merkle proof binding it to the chain head → see the signer + reason code + signed payload. **Cryptographic proof, not screenshots of PDFs.** Zero prep time for the hospital director; un-fakeable evidence. ServiceNow / Nuvolo cannot show this because their audit data is a relational query, not a chain.
- **Edge reinvention #35 — Cryptographic Key Custody & Locksmithing.** Nuvolo / ServiceNow ship a simple `keys` table linking keys to employees and doors. Easily broken (key holder leaves, key not returned, no audit trail). HubbleWave treats physical keys as restricted assets with the full regulated-action ledger: (a) `key_record` (`(id, key_serial, key_class, parent_master_key_id, opens_locks[], status ∈ {unassigned, issued, returned, lost, decommissioned})`); (b) `key_assignment` (taskable + regulated — every issuance requires e-signature from the holder per §3.6; `signature_chain_id` binds the transfer of custody); (c) `unrecovered_key_flag` (taskable) auto-generated by automation rule when an employee's HR record transitions to `terminated` while they still hold open key assignments — flags every outstanding key with a recovery WO + notifies Security Officer. Master-key issuance requires additional supervisor co-sign. Audit query: *"Show me every master-key transfer this quarter, with signer identity + reason code"* runs in seconds. Plugin: `<KeyCustodyLedger>` in Facilities Manager + Compliance Officer workspaces.

**UI Builder dog-food showpiece (per founder's demo recommendation):** **Compose the dispatcher workspace entirely in UI Builder** using `<PivotKanban>` (#18) and `<LiveCommandMap>` (#21) as registered plugin components — the layout, routes, filters, and widget wiring are all UI Builder authoring; the underlying React components ship in `@hubblewave/maintenance-plugins`. Show the evaluation committee: (a) the workspace authored in UI Builder ships with the platform; (b) the customer can fork it, pivot it differently, and add their own widget without code; (c) at 60fps + sub-second pivots on 100k+ WOs, the demo proves the §3.2 task_projection thesis. ServiceNow's map is a heavy add-on; this is native + composed.

**Demo storyboard (RFP closing scene — chains marquees 1-9 into one 18-minute narrative):**

> A nurse on the overnight shift scans the QR code on infusion pump 4521 in Room 312, holds the button, says *"Screen is frozen and it keeps beeping,"* walks away (marquee #3). 7:14 AM: Maria, the on-shift biomed tech, sees the structured WO at the top of her workspace. She swipes-right-to-start (marquee #6). She walks to Room 312, snaps a photo of the pump's faded nameplate to confirm identity (marquee #8). The WO's patient context is masked — she presses Break Glass, selects "Emergency Repair" (marquee #5), sees *"Airborne Isolation — N95 Required, Room 312 — VRE precautions"* revealed for 10 minutes. She asks AVA *"Error E-42?"* AVA renders an inline 6-step troubleshooting checklist drawn from the pump's service manual (marquee #2). Step 4 calls for a controller board — the WO already shows "Part reserved in Bin B4" from when the WO was triaged at 4:00 AM (marquee #4). She walks to the stockroom, grabs the part, returns. She loses Wi-Fi entering the elevator — the app keeps working (marquee #9). She steps through the checklist using thumb-toggles (no precision tapping with gloves), taps the mic, says *"Replaced the controller board, recalibrated to 50 PSI, ran self-test, all good."* AVA renders the compliance close-out narrative + reason codes + parts log (marquee #7). Maria swipes-right-to-complete (marquee #6) and e-signs (canon §10 hash chain). **Total time: 18 minutes.** With ServiceNow + Nuvolo: 45+ minutes, two trips to the stockroom, one missed PHI flag, and a compliance officer's nightmare close-out note.

- **v1 predictive (honest, no fake ML).** Explainable risk scoring on every asset surfaced in the Maintenance Manager workspace. Factors: WO history (recent failures, recurring corrective work), observation thresholds (out-of-band readings on bound streams), simple anomaly detection (z-score on rolling rollups). Each score carries rule-level provenance — clicking the score shows the exact factors that contributed. No per-customer trained ML model in v1; the explainability is the differentiator vs Nuvolo's blank dashboard and ServiceNow's BigQuery offload pattern. Backed by §3.5 observations + maintenance-core's WO history.

### 5.2 Post-Showcase Enhancements (explicitly outside pilot acceptance)

These three enhancements are platform commitments but are NOT gated by pilot acceptance. They land on the post-G6 roadmap. None of them is required for the showcase pilot's category-defining demo; deferring them lets the showcase ship at G6 without scope creep:

- **Per-customer trained predictive maintenance ML models.** Pilot features (#4 Predictive Parts Staging, #16 Smart Sprint, #17 Repair-vs-Replace, v1 risk scoring) all ship as **deterministic + explainable rule-based scoring with provenance** — no trained ML required for the showcase. Trained ML refinement is post-G6 work that strictly improves accuracy on top of the same explainable substrate, via self-hosted Ollama for inference + single-tenant SageMaker (or equivalent) for training (multi-tenant managed ML services violate canon §5 instance isolation under PHI).
- **AI Code Assistant for end-customer plugin authoring.** Canon §11 commits to this; the implementation lands post-G6 after the maintenance pack proves the customization model. Customers in the showcase pilot get UI Builder authoring without code-assist.
- **Live UI Builder workspace authoring on mobile.** Web UI Builder is in the showcase; on-mobile authoring is post-G6 (web → publish → mobile refresh is sufficient for the showcase narrative).

### 5.3 Phase gates (~36-44 weeks, 8 gates)

Each gate ends with a working demo and a Go/No-Go decision. No giant final-integration crunch. G0 is split because shipping all 11 substrate sections in 6 weeks is not credible.

| Gate | Week | Acceptance demo |
|---|---:|---|
| **G0a** — Foundation substrate | 5 | §3.1 taskable + §3.3 scheduling + §3.4 list-scale framework + §3.5 observations base (pg_partman + ingest only, no rollups) + §3.6 regulated-action single-signature path + processed_events ledger + Redis Consumer Groups + idempotency scaffold; foundation CI scanners green. Demo: synthetic taskable collection installed → `generation_runs` idempotency holds under double-fire → observation ingest hits the pg_partman partition → single-signature flow extends the chain. |
| **G0b** — Advanced substrate | 11 | §3.2 task_projection (circuit breaker + tombstones + reconciliation), §3.6 Merkle batch, §3.7 mobile parity (UI primitives + Elevator Mode), §3.8 AVA UI synthesis, §3.9 public intake (hardened), §3.10 break-glass override, §3.11 external-collaborator session tokens, observation rollup jobs. Demo: 100k WO bulk-import → circuit breaker keeps list views responsive → Merkle batch of 50 signatures + replay attack rejected → kiosk session bound to a device → revoke is one-tap. |
| **G0c** — Shared substrate for marquees #23-35 | 17 | §3.12 Storage/Evidence Attachment Runtime + §3.13 Connector Runtime + certified simulators + §3.14 Semantic Search/Vector Match + §3.15 Spatial+Graph + §3.16 Financial Control + §3.17 Bulk Import Staging + §3.18 Integration Secrets + Egress Policy. Demo: pre-signed upload + AV-scan + object-lock works end-to-end; one connector adapter runs in both live + simulator modes with conformance proof; semantic match returns explainable confidence bands; floor-plan graph route-solves a 4-floor hospital fixture; three-way match + separation-of-duties enforces on a synthetic invoice; bulk import publishes 5,000 rows atomically; NAC adapter refuses to fire without dual-confirmation guardrails. |
| **G1** — maintenance-core core | 23 | Assets + WO + PM + checklists + technician mobile workspace live; AI marquee #1 (voice WO capture) demonstrable; v1 explainable risk scoring live in Maintenance Manager workspace; Compliance Officer workspace shows the platform audit chain. |
| **G2** — Three overlays + AI marquees 1-5 + Edge marquees #31 + #33 | 31 | Clinical + Facilities + OT Security overlays installable without collision; UDI lookup live; BACnet + Claroty + Medigate + Asimily live or certified-simulator; AI marquees #1-5 + edge marquees #31 (Semantic Recall) + #33 (Auto-Commissioning) demonstrable; three-overlays-installed CI test passes. |
| **G3** — Technician + Connected-network superpowers + Rounds + Calibration Blast Radius | 37 | #6-13 all live; Rounds dedicated mobile tab live (Batch Observation Sessions per #25); edge marquee #32 (Analyzer Blast Radius via §3.15 spatial-graph) live; all three overlays' OOTB workspaces author-able in UI Builder. |
| **G4** — Systemic + Contracts + Space + Capital + JIT Procurement + Invoice + Key Custody | 43 | #14-17 all live; #27 Capital Active Intercept live (via §3.16 financial control); #28 JIT Procurement live; #29 AI invoice reconciliation live; #35 Key Custody with co-sign live; expanded contracts + facilities space management live; 8th + 9th OOTB workspaces (Auditor, OT Security Officer) operating. |
| **G5** — WO-processing visualization views + Fleet + Joint Commission Merkle Proof | 47 | #18-22 all live at 60fps on demo dataset; #30 Fleet-as-Asset live (vehicles via §3.5 telematics; mileage-PM utilization-trigger); #34 Joint Commission Merkle Proof live (Auditor Kiosk shows signature_chains drilldown); UI Builder dog-food showpiece. |
| **G6** — Scale + on-site demo readiness | 50 | `apps/scale-rig` produces 3M assets / 20M WOs / **≤10B observations**; hot list views stay snapshot-backed under load; mobile selective-sync pulls < 1MB metadata/list payload for a single technician's day; perf baseline frozen in `docs/scale-baselines/v1.json`; on-site mobile field test in a hospital dead-zone / MRI-adjacent approved test area with intermittent connectivity passes; regulator-export rehearsal validates against HubbleWave attestation schema mapped to Part 11 controls + Joint Commission readiness rubric. **Demo to RFP committee at gate close.** |

Each gate is gated by: CI green, scanner self-tests green, the demo for that gate runs end-to-end without manual intervention, and a written gate-acceptance memo signed by the Maintenance Manager persona test-user (internal). Gate slip → re-baseline before continuing.

**Live-integration rule (binding for all integration-dependent gates):** Every integration adapter (HL7v2, FHIR R4, BACnet, Modbus, ECRI feed, FDA UDI, AutoCAD DWG, IFC, EHR vendor APIs) ships in **one of two modes** — *live* where customer credentials + sandbox environment are available, *certified simulator* otherwise. Simulator certifications declare conformance level (e.g. "HL7 v2.5.1 ADT-A08 covered; ORU-R01 covered; remaining segments stubbed"). Acceptance demos pass on simulator where live access is gated by vendor/customer access. This rule exists so the pilot does NOT block on access negotiations, only on engineering.

### 5.4 Personas Covered (the RFP voting matrix)

Every persona that votes on the RFP gets their own "wow" moment. No single feature has to please everyone — the design ensures coverage:

| Persona | Their pain today | Our wow moment |
|---|---|---|
| Nurse (floor staff) | Portal logins, 5 required fields, 3-minute ticket to report a broken pump | Walk-by intake (marquee #3): QR + voice + walk away |
| Technician (biomed, facilities) | Glove-unfriendly UI, dead-zone spinners, typing close-out notes on a phone | Glove-Mode swipe (#6) + Generative close-out (#7) + Dirty Nameplate (#8) + Elevator Mode (#9) |
| Junior technician / new hire | Asset hunting, lost institutional knowledge, getting lost in the building | Asset Pins (#11) + Floor-Plan Routing (#12) + Invisible Manual (#2) |
| Dispatcher | Manual ticket assignment, dead-walking, no schedule awareness | Smart Sprint batching (#16) |
| Maintenance Manager | KPIs locked behind report-builder | OOTB workspace + replacement-urgency board (#17) |
| Compliance Officer | Auditor panic, custom report-building | Auditor Kiosk (#14) + break-glass forensic log (#5) + LOTO mathematical evidence (#13) |
| Safety Officer | OSHA paper-binders, LOTO sequence enforcement | Smart LOTO with AVA Vision (#13) |
| External Contractor | Email-thread chaos, no platform visibility | Zero-Login Contractor Flow (#15) |
| Finance Director / CFO | Capital planning by gut-feeling, asset replacement decisions | Repair-vs-Replace score (#17) |
| IT Admin (RFP gatekeeper) | ServiceNow upgrade breakage, customization-vs-upgrade tension | Verified Pack Registry (§8 §17.5) + upgrade-safety validator + N=2 SDK stability (canon §25) |
| CISO / Privacy Officer | Static ACLs, PHI in WO notes locked away | Break-Glass PHI (#5) — dynamic, time-limited, audited |
| OT Security Officer | Medical-device vulns invisible to facilities team; manual Claroty/Medigate triage | `ws_ot_security_officer` workspace + `<OtAssetRiskMap>` + `<VulnerabilityTracker>` + Claroty/Medigate/Asimily live feeds + AVA Convergence Routing (#26) (§4.4 overlay) |
| Space Planner / Workplace Manager | Manual seat charts; double-booked rooms; move-day chaos | Live Operational Canvas (#24) + `<SpaceReservationCalendar>` + `<MoveRequestBoard>` + `<OccupancyHeatmap>` + Invisible Space Audits via Wi-Fi/BT beacon (§4.3 facilities) |
| Procurement Manager | Reactive PO firefighting; stock hits zero before reorder | Autonomous JIT Procurement (#28) — AVA-drafted `procurement_proposal` shopping carts with full provenance |
| Accounts Payable / Finance | Manual invoice-vs-WO reconciliation; vendor billing disputes | AI-Enforced Vendor Invoice Reconciliation (#29) — only pre-reconciled or explicitly variance-approved invoices reach AP |
| Capital Planner / Director | Capital-vs-repair decisions made on gut feel | Predictive TCO Active Intercept (#27) — repair-cost-over-residual-value triggers `capital_replacement_request` at the operational moment |
| Fleet Manager | Disconnected fleet module separate from facility CMMS | Fleet-as-Asset (#30) — vehicles ARE assets; OBD2 telematics feeds the same observation substrate; mileage-based PM via utilization-trigger; no separate fleet module |

Demo strategy: pitch the right feature to the right persona during the RFP meeting. Every voter gets one moment that says *"this is built for me."*

## 6. Full Showcase Build Decomposition

The work breakdown for the Full Showcase Pilot. Total: ~140-160 PRs over 50 weeks, aligned to the gates in §5.3. Phase durations sum to gate-week targets exactly.

- **Phase 0** (1 week, ~6 PRs): canon amendments, spec doc, plan-fix doc, Appendix D update, capability vocabulary doc, scanner ownership rules. **Prerequisite gate: W2 Stream 1 platform-blocker cleanup must be complete per §1.1.**
- **Phase 1a** (4 weeks, ~12 PRs) → **gate G0a (week 5)**: foundation substrate — §3.1 taskable + §3.3 scheduling + §3.4 list-scale + §3.5 observations base + §3.6 regulated-action single-signature + processed_events + Redis Consumer Groups + idempotency scaffold.
- **Phase 1b** (6 weeks, ~14 PRs) → **gate G0b (week 11)**: advanced substrate — §3.2 task_projection with circuit-breaker + tombstones + reconciliation + §3.6 Merkle batch + §3.7 mobile parity + §3.8 AVA UI synthesis + §3.9 public intake hardened + §3.10 break-glass + §3.11 external-collaborator sessions + observation rollup jobs.
- **Phase 1c** (6 weeks, ~16 PRs) → **gate G0c (week 17)**: shared substrate — §3.12 Storage/Evidence + §3.13 Connector Runtime + simulators + §3.14 Semantic Search/Vector + §3.15 Spatial+Graph + §3.16 Financial Control + §3.17 Bulk Import + §3.18 Integration Secrets + Egress Policy. These prevent the marquees #23-35 from inventing ad-hoc versions.
- **Phase 2** (6 weeks, ~22 PRs) → **gate G1 (week 17)**: full `maintenance-core` core slice (assets, WO, PM, checklists, technician workspace, Compliance Officer workspace, AI marquee #1).
- **Phase 2** (6 weeks, ~22 PRs) → **gate G1 (week 23)**: full `maintenance-core` core slice (assets, WO, PM, checklists, technician workspace, Compliance Officer workspace, AI marquee #1).
- **Phase 3** (8 weeks, ~24 PRs) → **gate G2 (week 31)**: full three overlays (Clinical, Facilities, OT Security) + AI marquees #2-5 + edge marquees #31 (Semantic Recall) + #33 (Auto-Commissioning); HL7v2 + FHIR + BACnet + Claroty + Medigate + Asimily wired (live or certified-simulator per §5.3 rule).
- **Phase 4** (6 weeks, ~18 PRs) → **gate G3 (week 37)**: Technician superpowers #6-9 + Connected-network #10-13 + Rounds dedicated mobile tab + edge marquee #32 (Analyzer Blast Radius).
- **Phase 5** (6 weeks, ~18 PRs) → **gate G4 (week 43)**: Systemic differentiators #14-17 + Auditor workspace + expanded contracts + facilities space management + back-office reinventions #27 (Capital) + #28 (JIT Procurement) + #29 (Invoice Reconciliation) + #35 (Key Custody).
- **Phase 6** (4 weeks, ~14 PRs) → **gate G5 (week 47)**: WO-processing visualization views #18-22 + #30 Fleet-as-Asset + #34 Joint Commission Merkle Proof + UI Builder dog-food showpiece.
- **Phase 7** (3 weeks, ~10 PRs) → **gate G6 (week 50)**: scale rig (3M assets / 20M WOs / ≤10B observations), three-overlays-installed test suite, workspace-leakage tests, mobile offline-conflict tests, attestation export validation, upgrade-validator extension tests, on-site mobile field test, perf baseline freeze. **Demo to RFP committee at gate close.**

Sum: 1 + 4 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 8 + 6 + 6 + 4 + 3 = 50 weeks. Per-gate slip budget (§11.1 q1) absorbs the remaining headroom.

Post-Showcase Enhancements (§5.2 — per-customer trained ML, AI Code Assistant for end-customer plugin authoring, live UI Builder workspace authoring on mobile) are NOT in this decomposition.

## 7. Risk Register (HIGH only — full list in spec doc)

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|---:|---|
| `task_projection` lag under burst load (200k-WO import saturates queue) | HIGH | (a) Bulk-import bypass writes projection rows in source transaction via explicit service-boundary allowlist; (b) Redis Consumer Groups distribute the fan-out across N worker pods (§19 amendment); (c) **circuit-breaker on list views** — at lag > 30s serve stale + "Syncing…" banner, NEVER fallback to source-table queries (thundering herd); single-record fetches retain source fallback. |
| Workspace leakage between Clinical + Facilities overlays installed together | HIGH | Pack manifest declares `owned_collections` + `references_collections` separately; upgrade validator extension checks every workspace view binding against installing pack's `owned + references` set; CI tests both overlays installed simultaneously. |
| 21 CFR Part 11 e-signature replay attack | HIGH | `signature_chains.this_hash` computed over `(record_id, action_code, signed_payload_hash, prev_hash)` — replay impossible. Merkle batch root (§3.6) inherits the same property: each leaf hash binds to record+action, and the proof binds the leaf to the root. Explicit replay attack tests in compliance integration suite cover both single-action and batch-via-Merkle paths. |
| Public intake endpoint as attack surface (§3.9 — QR token leak, abuse, payload injection) | HIGH | Signed tokens via KMS (kid per instance); bound to specific record (leaked QR for asset A cannot submit against asset B); per-token + per-IP rate limit; max-payload size; AV scan on attachments; gitleaks scan on free text; endpoint never returns operational data; rate-limit breach + scan-fail emit `RuntimeAnomaly` rows for ops alerts. Pack manifest declares per-purpose schemas — payload that fails schema rejected with structured error. |
| Break-glass field-override abuse (§3.10 — unauthorized unmask of PHI) | HIGH | Eligibility role-bound at the §28 level; reason code REQUIRED (selected from per-pack vocabulary, not free-text); every grant emits signature_chains row chained to actor's session; Compliance Officer workspace surfaces a forensic log every grant; auto-revoke at `granted_until`; quarterly auditor query rehearsals built into v1 verification. |
| NAC quarantine false positive (§3.18 + #26) causing clinical-operations impact | HIGH | Dual-confirmation required (Security Officer + Maintenance Manager); customer-policy override flag; criticality precheck refuses quarantine on life-support assets without explicit override; per-customer kill switch + automatic rollback within N seconds if downstream telemetry shows clinical-state impact; signature_chains-audited; every fire recorded with the precheck evidence row. |
| Technician/occupancy/location tracking labor + privacy challenge (§3.5 + #10 + #24) | HIGH | Opt-in per individual with documented retention; "Go Invisible" toggle; aggregated room-level only for occupancy (5-min buckets, never per-individual); customer-admin policy disclosed at onboarding; per-jurisdiction policy variants (US right-to-work vs EU GDPR vs union-CBA defaults); legal review gate before deployment to a customer in a jurisdiction not previously cleared. |
| Auto-commissioning (#33) publishing bad asset/location data at scale | HIGH | AVA confidence threshold per row + reviewer grid; bulk publish runs in a single DB transaction with rollback affordance for 24h; pack manifest declares per-collection minimum-confidence-for-auto-accept thresholds (default very high); orphan-location detector (asset references location not in the registry) blocks publish until resolved. |
| Semantic recall false negatives (#31) — FDA/ECRI notice misses an affected asset | HIGH | Layered match: vector semantic match (high recall, lower precision) PLUS lexical fuzzy match PLUS manufacturer-ID join; confidence < 0.70 still surfaces for biomed-engineer one-tap-confirm rather than silent miss; weekly QA replay of last quarter's ECRI feed against a known-truth corpus; FDA-recall miss is a P0 incident with named post-mortem owner. |
| Vendor invoice / payment fraud via #29 contractor portal or document extraction | HIGH | Three-way match (§3.16 financial control) enforced by separation-of-duties; AVA-extracted amounts cross-checked against `master_service_agreement` rates extracted at intake; contractor portal sessions tied to magic-link single-use consumption; high-variance invoices route to human Accounts Payable review with reason codes; AVA never auto-approves over a customer-configurable amount threshold. |
| Procurement approval abuse / AVA over-ordering (#28) | HIGH | `procurement_proposal` is always advisory; never auto-converts to `purchase_order` without Procurement Manager approval; separation-of-duties enforced (proposer ≠ approver above threshold); per-period budget envelope check (§3.16 budget_envelope) blocks proposals that would breach budget; weekly AVA-vs-actual consumption variance analysis surfaces overordering patterns for review. |
| 10B-observation vanilla Postgres operational ceiling | HIGH | G6 scale rig caps at ≤10B observations to stay within vanilla-PG + pg_partman comfort; TimescaleDB adoption gate triggered automatically when a customer's projected volume crosses 8B (early warning at 80% of fork point); migration runbook + customer-onboarding pre-flight check published; per-instance partition-steward observability surfaces hot-partition lag before it becomes a query-killer. |
| OT advisory / vulnerability feed poisoning (#26, #31) | HIGH | Feed-provider TLS cert pinning + signed-advisory verification where the provider supports it (FDA UDI, ECRI, vendor-specific manufacturer feeds); anomaly detection on advisory ingest (sudden volume spike, unusual severity distribution); ingest stages to `security_advisory` with `status = quarantined_pending_review` for any feed-poisoning indicator; OT Security Officer must explicitly approve before mitigation actions cascade. |
| Mobile offline regulated signature ambiguity (#7 + #9 + #13 + §3.6 + §3.7) | HIGH | Mobile-captured signatures buffered locally with a unique `intent_id`; on sync, the server re-authenticates the user via session re-bind + verifies the signed payload hasn't changed since offline capture; if re-auth fails (session-stamp bump per canon §29.6 happened while offline), the signature is rejected and the action requires re-sign with current session; UI clearly indicates "offline-pending" vs "signed-and-synced" state. |

Twenty-four additional MED-severity risks (TimescaleDB fork-point management; mobile conflict policy; 7-year archive query; pack version coordination; FormDefinition portability; projection authz on rule edits; per-customer ML training infrastructure — post-showcase only; AVA UI synthesis correctness; predictive parts staging accuracy; **rollup-job lag + backfill correctness** — scheduled SQL upsert jobs must catch up correctly after partition rollover or worker outage; pg_partman partition-steward correctness (orphaned partitions, mis-aligned retention windows); SwipeProgressCard cross-platform parity; AVA Vision OCR accuracy on scratched/dirty nameplates; Generative close-out reason-code accuracy; technician presence privacy; asset-pin moderation + abuse; floor-plan routing graph correctness; Smart LOTO vision-failure handling; kiosk session token leak; magic-link contractor token misuse; Smart Sprint optimization edge cases; replacement-urgency score correctness; Live Command Map technician-tracking accuracy; Pivot-Kanban macro side-effects; Triage Deck keyboard-shortcut hijack) and two LOW (scale rig location, AI false-positive WO storms) tracked in the spec doc.

## 8. Canon Amendments Required (Phase 0)

| Section | Change | New/Update |
|---|---|---|
| §13 | Extend upgrade validator: verify taskable collections still satisfy `taskable_required_fields`; mobile-syncable forms still web+mobile-renderable; no orphaned `audit_log_id` in `signature_chains`. | Update |
| §17 | Add `maintenance-core`, `clinical-maintenance`, `facilities-maintenance`, **`ot-security-maintenance`** to monolith inventory as HubbleWave-owned PACKS (not modules). List new platform API modules: `capabilities`, `compliance`, `observations`, `mobile`, `scheduling`, `projections`, `intake`. **No `maintenance` API module** — maintenance is a pack, not platform code; this is load-bearing for the §17.5 customization-contract story. | Update |
| §17.5 | HubbleWave-owned packs follow the same upgrade-safety + versioning contract as customer packs. No platform-pack admin bypass. **Introduce a Verified Pack Registry**: HubbleWave-owned packs (and customer-trusted partner packs) install via the standard pack-install pipeline but with a cryptographic signature check against the registry's signing key; prevents customer packs from hijacking platform-reserved namespaces like `maintenance-core`. | Update |
| §19 NEW (UPDATE) | **Horizontal worker scaling.** `apps/worker` runs as multiple pods per instance, consuming `instance_event_outbox`, `obs.ingest`, and projection-rebuild queues via **Redis Consumer Groups (at-least-once delivery)**. Workers achieve **effectively-once processing** through idempotency: every outbox event has a unique `event_id`; a `processed_events` ledger gates each apply; mutations are idempotent UPSERTs or use unique generation keys (`generation_runs.idempotency_key`); tombstones are retry-safe. Redis Streams' XACK + claim-timeout reassigns in-flight messages on pod death without loss. Pool sizing per-instance configurable. SPOF eliminated. | Update |
| §21 | Extend service-boundary scanner ownership rules for every new table (`taskable_*`, `task_projection*`, `observations.*`, `compliance.*`, `mobile_sync_*`, scheduling tables). | Update |
| §30 NEW | **Capability Contracts.** Domain collections opt into platform capabilities declaratively via metadata. Each capability has a required-fields contract; validator refuses publish when missing. Capabilities never imply table inheritance — composition over projection. | New |
| §31 NEW | **Time-Series Observations.** Dedicated `observations` schema using Postgres declarative partitioning with **pg_partman (auto-managed partitions) adopted Day-1**. Rollups in explicit purpose-built tables (`observation_rollups_hourly/daily/weekly`) refreshed by **scheduled SQL upsert jobs**; aggregation math runs in Postgres, the worker only issues the statement and observes lag. **pg_ivm rejected for v1** — its base tables must be non-partitioned and its immediate-maintenance degrades under high-volume writes. TimescaleDB remains a deferred escape valve for >10B observations/instance. Node-side rollup computation rejected outright. | New |
| §32 NEW | **Regulated-Action Primitives.** E-signature, reason codes, immutable evidence artifacts, signature_chains ledger parallel to audit_logs chain. Hash chains + Merkle roots are **evidence mechanics**, not Part 11 compliance by themselves. §32 commits to the full Part 11 envelope: validation evidence (IQ/OQ/PQ change-control export), authority checks (§28 + §29.6 at sign-time), operational checks (sequence enforcement), 7-year audit retention (§34 archive partitions), record copy/export (single attestation file per record), signer identity binding (re-auth per signature meaning), meaning of signature (enum-valued), reason codes (codified vocabulary, never free-text), controlled-session rules (idle timeout, re-auth-on-resume). Merkle batch leaf MUST bind `(signer, timestamp, action, record, reason, meaning, payload_hash)`; non-Merkle batched signature_chains inserts forbidden. | New |
| §33 NEW | **Mobile Runtime Parity + Field-Tool Primitives.** Pack-shipped FormDefinitions and WorkspacePages render semantically equivalent on web and mobile via `@hubblewave/ui-primitives` vocabulary only. Vocabulary includes field-tool primitives (`SwipeProgressCard`, `ThumbToggle`, `LargeActionButton`, `NameplateCamera`) designed for the technician's physical reality (gloves, ladders, dim/dirty nameplates, intermittent Wi-Fi). **"Elevator Mode" UX contract:** mobile app never blocks on network state; every action locally optimistic with <16ms UI response; WatermelonDB stores local state; background sync silent. Customer forms may use web-only primitives but flagged `web_only` and excluded from mobile sync. | New |
| §34 NEW | **List-Scale Primitives.** Hot list views backed by materialized snapshots or projection rows; runtime list endpoint may not scan partitioned domain tables >1M rows. Active/archive partitioning policy-driven per collection. Archived data queryable via explicit facade with audit-logged access. | New |
| §35 NEW | **Scheduling Primitives.** Recurrence, suppression windows, blackout calendars, shift calendars as platform primitives. Generation jobs emitting domain records must record idempotency key; unique constraint is the correctness guarantee (not check-then-write). | New |
| §11 (extension) | **AVA Runtime UI Synthesis.** AVA may emit transient `FormDefinition` JSON that renders via `@hubblewave/ui-primitives` without persisting to metadata. Synthesis passes the same validator as pack-shipped forms — vocabulary-restricted, no escape hatches. Every synthesis logs an `AVAProposal` row for canon §12 trust progression. Refused synthesis returns a structured error, never a runtime exception. | Update |
| §28.10 NEW | **Break-Glass Field Override (eligibility-gated, hard-deny enforced).** Time-bound, audited unmask of §28 field masking. PropertyDefinition gains `break_glass_eligible boolean` and `confidentiality_class varchar(64)` ∈ `{public, internal, sensitive, never_reveal, legal_hold, sealed_investigation, system_secret, unrelated_patient_context}`. §28.5 evaluator runs three stages in order: (1) **hard-deny check** — confidentiality_class in {never_reveal, legal_hold, sealed_investigation, system_secret, unrelated_patient_context} → DENY unconditionally, no grant overrides; (2) **active-grant check** — only on `break_glass_eligible = true` properties; (3) **normal masking** otherwise. Validator refuses publish when `break_glass_eligible = true` AND class is hard-deny (mutually exclusive). Auto-revoke at `granted_until`. Every grant emits signature_chains + audit_logs rows transactionally. | New |
| §36 NEW | **Public Intake Endpoints (hardened).** Signed-token scoped unauthenticated POST endpoints with per-record binding. Hard contract: endpoint **never returns operational data**, only a submission code. Per-asset revoke + quarantine in one tap. Token rotation option per pack-manifest (lifetime or cadence-rotated). Replay idempotency via client-generated submission UUID. Rate limits + payload bounds + AV scan + secret scan + geo-anomaly detection are platform defaults; all failures emit `RuntimeAnomaly` + page-on-call. Pack manifest declares per-purpose payload schemas under `public_intake.schemas[]`. Submissions route through AVA pipeline using a system-principal scoped to the intake purpose. | New |
| §29.11 NEW (extension) | **External-Collaborator Session Tokens.** Two complementary patterns for non-account-holding external users: (a) **kiosk sessions** — read-only, time-bound, device-fingerprint-bound JWTs (aud=`kiosk`); (b) **magic-link collaborator invitations** — single-use SMS/email-delivered tokens scoped to one record + narrow permitted-actions (aud=`collaborator`). Both KMS-signed per canon §29.1. JwtAuthGuard branches on audience to build `KioskRequestContext` / `CollaboratorRequestContext` (extensions to RequestContext discriminated union). Token issuance + redemption + revoke recorded in `audit_logs` AND `signature_chains` jointly. | New |
| §38 NEW | **Storage & Evidence Attachment Runtime.** Pre-signed upload pipeline + immutable storage with S3 object-lock + scanning (AV, secret, PII) + retention (`retention_until` + `legal_hold`) + content-hash + version_id. Packs request uploads via `requestUpload(purpose, scope)`; never touch storage tables. Clean attachments transition to linked `evidence_artifacts` (§3.6). | New |
| §39 NEW | **Connector Runtime + Certified Simulators.** All integration adapters declare against the `IntegrationAdapter` SDK interface and ship in both live + simulator modes with conformance declarations + fixture-replay test history. Pack manifests declare `integrations[]` with minimum-conformance-version requirements; install refuses on incompatible adapters. The §5.3 live-or-simulator rule is enforceable because conformance is verifiable. | New |
| §40 NEW | **Semantic Search / Vector Match.** Platform pgvector embedding index over pack-declared text fields (`PropertyDefinition.vector_indexed = true`). `semanticMatch(query, collectionId, options)` returns ranked candidates with confidence bands (high > 0.85, med 0.70-0.85, low < 0.70) + explainable factors. Per-instance embedding-model registry supports rotation. | New |
| §41 NEW | **Spatial + Relationship Graph.** Generic graph store + traversal API. `traverse(start, edge_filter, depth_limit)` for BFS/DFS; `routeSolve(graph_id, from, to, weighting)` for floor-plan nav; `blastRadius(start, edge_kind, depth, time_window)` for #32 reverse-traceability. Pack-publish validator checks orphan nodes + cycle rules. | New |
| §42 NEW | **Financial Control.** Approval limits + separation-of-duties + three-way match + variance reason codes + budget envelopes. The `transaction_approval` taskable workflow enforces requester ≠ approver above threshold. Three-way match (PO + Invoice + Receipt) is platform-level; packs supply line-item logic but cannot bypass the match. | New |
| §43 NEW | **Bulk Import / Commissioning Staging.** Generic `import_batch` + `import_row` + `import_review_session` substrate. Atomic publish in a single DB transaction with 24h rollback affordance. Packs (incl. #33 Auto-Commissioning) consume this — they do NOT ship their own bulk-import collections. | New |
| §44 NEW | **Integration Secrets + Egress Policy.** Per-instance KMS-encrypted secrets vault (`integration_secret`) + outbound deny-by-default with explicit `egress_allowlist_entry` per adapter + per-adapter kill switch + every outbound call logged. NAC quarantine actions (#26) require dual-confirmation + customer-policy override + asset-criticality precheck — refuse to fire without all three. | New |

## 9. Critical Files

Five load-bearing files for the entire build:

- `C:\Dev\HW-Platform\HW Platform\CLAUDE.md` — canon amendments (extension §11, §13, §17, §17.5, §19, §21, §28.10, §29.11, new §30, §31, §32, §33, §34, §35, §36).
- `C:\Dev\HW-Platform\HW Platform\libs\instance-db\src\lib\entities\index.ts` — per-area re-exports (lines 23-30) and `instanceEntities` array (lines 261-528). Every new entity registers here.
- `C:\Dev\HW-Platform\HW Platform\libs\packs\src\lib\manifest.ts` — manifest schema (lines 36-65); extend with `provides_capabilities`, `requires_capabilities`, `capability_bindings`, `task_projection.attrs[]` (projection schema gate per §3.2), `public_intake.schemas[]` (intake payload schema per §3.9), and `pivot_kanban.column_transitions[]` (macro binding per §11.1 q19).
- `C:\Dev\HW-Platform\HW Platform\apps\api\src\app\metadata\packs\packs.service.ts` — pack install/upgrade entry points (`installPack` at :111).
- `C:\Dev\HW-Platform\HW Platform\tools\service-boundary-check.ts` — ownership rules for every new table.

Existing primitives reused (no reinvention):

- `libs\instance-db\src\lib\entities\sla.entity.ts:46` (BusinessHours), `:101` (SLADefinition), `:183` (SLAInstance), `:336` (StateMachineDefinition) — taskable foundation.
- `libs\instance-db\src\lib\entities\automation.entity.ts:52` (AutomationRule), `:222` (ScheduledJob) — PM orchestration.
- `libs\instance-db\src\lib\entities\workspace.entity.ts:33` (WorkspaceDefinition), `:135` (WorkspacePage), `:201` (WorkspaceVariant) — 9 OOTB workspaces (Technician mobile-first, Dispatcher, Maintenance Manager, Biomed Engineer, Facilities Manager, Compliance Officer, FCA Inspector, Auditor Kiosk, OT Security Officer).
- `libs\instance-db\src\lib\entities\app-builder.entity.ts:678` (SensorReading) — to be REPLACED (greenfield, not extended) by new `observations` schema per §31.
- `libs\instance-db\src\lib\audit\with-audit.ts:63` — pattern that `signature_chains` writer follows for Plan Fix 41 linearization.

New area files:

- `libs\instance-db\src\lib\entities\capabilities.entity.ts`
- `libs\instance-db\src\lib\entities\compliance.entity.ts`
- `libs\instance-db\src\lib\entities\observations.entity.ts`
- `libs\instance-db\src\lib\entities\scheduling.entity.ts`
- `libs\instance-db\src\lib\entities\mobile.entity.ts`

Worker process additions (`apps\worker\src\`). **Note:** `apps/worker` runs as multiple horizontally-scaled pods per instance (per §8 §19 amendment), consuming queues via Redis Consumer Groups for safe concurrent delivery.

- `projections\task-projection\` — `TaskProjectionConsumer` (one-per-pod via Consumer Group; partitioned consumption by `task_kind`)
- `scheduling\generation.service.ts` — generic generation dispatcher (consumes scheduled rules via the platform automation engine and writes idempotent rows to `generation_runs`; maintenance-core's PM rules feed it but the service has no maintenance coupling)
- `observations\adapters\` + `observations\ingest.service.ts` — sensor ingest pipeline (batched COPY writes; aggregation handled by `rollup.service.ts` via scheduled SQL upsert jobs against the explicit rollup tables — no pg_ivm, no Node-side math)
- `observations\rollup.service.ts` — schedules SQL upsert jobs against the explicit rollup tables (`observation_rollups_hourly/daily/weekly`); each job is a parameterized `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` whose aggregation runs entirely in Postgres; the service observes refresh lag and alerts when behind. pg_ivm is NOT used (see §3.5 decision); Node-side rollup math is rejected.
- `archive\partition-steward.job.ts` — active/archive transitions (uses pg_partman primitives where applicable)

---

## 10. Verification Plan

Each substrate addition has self-test scope. Each pack has integration-test scope. The pilot has a customer-facing acceptance scope.

### 10.1 Substrate (Phase 1 acceptance)
- **taskable capability:** Metadata validator self-test — opt-in a synthetic collection missing `state` field → publish must fail with structured error. Self-test grows to ≥10 assertions.
- **task_projection:** Insert 100k WOs across 3 task_kinds → projection lag stays < 1s p95 under normal load. Bucket-hash authz pre-filter matches a hand-computed expected row set on 5 ACL test fixtures.
- **task_projection circuit-breaker (edge case).** Simulate 200k WO bulk-import. Expect: active UI shows "Syncing…" banner; **zero source-table fallback queries on list endpoints** (verified via DB query log); single-record fetches continue to work via source fallback. Confirms no thundering-herd failure mode.
- **task_projection reconciler (edge case for scale rig).** With 20M-WO DB, run reconciler on cold partitions; verify it uses `ACCESS SHARE` lock only (never blocks active partition writes); produces correct diff in < 1 hour for one partition pair.
- **scheduling:** Generator self-test — schedule + subject record + suppression window → exactly one record generated; second worker scoop fails the `idempotency_key` unique constraint and is logged as `RuntimeAnomaly`. RRULE parsing self-test ≥15 assertions.
- **observations:** Ingest 1M readings across 10 streams via worker batches; verify pg_partman creates next month's partition automatically; explicit rollup tables (`observation_rollups_hourly/daily/weekly`) reflect new readings within the scheduled-job interval (default 5 min for hourly, 1 hour for daily); rollup values match a hand-computed `min/max/avg/p95`; rollup-refresh lag observable via `task_projection_lag`-equivalent operational table.
- **regulated-action (single + Merkle batch):** Replay attack on single signature → rejected. Merkle batch of 50 signatures → one root row in `signature_chains`, 50 leaf records with valid Merkle proofs binding `(signer, timestamp, action, record, reason, meaning, payload_hash)`; tampering with one leaf invalidates its proof; replay of the entire batch root → rejected. Audit chain + signature chain both extend correctly. Compliance attestation export validates against the **HubbleWave attestation schema mapped to Part 11 controls** for both flows.
- **mobile parity:** Same FormDefinition JSON renders **semantically equivalent** on web (Storybook) and mobile (Detox snapshot — semantic-tree equivalence, not pixel diff) for the 9 primitive components. End-to-end demo: edit a workspace via web UI Builder → publish → mobile workspace refresh shows the change within one pull cycle.
- **mobile sync conflict (edge case).** Technician A and Technician B both go offline and complete the same `checklist_instance` task; both come online. Verify the per-collection conflict policy resolves correctly: last-write-wins on completion fields (latest answer / photo / note); server-wins on header fields (assigned_to, state); ambiguous cases queued in `mobile_sync_conflicts` for Compliance Officer review. WO state never enters an inconsistent state during resolution.
- **horizontal worker (edge case).** Spin up 3 worker pods consuming the same projection queue via Redis Consumer Group; produce 10k outbox events; verify **at-least-once delivery + effectively-once processing**: zero duplicate effects in the projection table despite injected duplicate deliveries (Redis Stream replay simulating XACK loss). Each duplicate hits the `processed_events` ledger and no-ops. Roughly equal load distribution across pods. Killing one pod mid-batch → remaining pods absorb in-flight messages via XCLAIM within the Consumer Group claim timeout (default 30s); reclaimed messages re-process idempotently with no duplicate effects.
- **AVA UI synthesis (Invisible Manual marquee).** AVA ingests a sample Baxter Sigma Spectrum manual PDF via document AI; technician asks "Error Code E-42"; AVA synthesizes a 6-step troubleshooting checklist; validator accepts (only `@hubblewave/ui-primitives` vocabulary used); checklist renders semantically equivalent on web Storybook + RN Detox; each step completion writes to `AVAProposal` row. Synthesis of a payload with forbidden component (e.g., raw HTML escape) → validator rejects with structured error; no runtime exception.
- **Public intake (Walk-by marquee).** QR scan → unauthenticated POST with JSON body (≤50KB) + attachment upload to pre-signed S3 URL (audio ≤25MB, AV + secret-scan + quarantine before AVA reads) → AVA structuring → WO created with biomed-routed assignment within 5s; rate limit kicks in at 10 submissions/min per token; JSON payload >50KB rejected; attachment scan failure → attachment quarantined + anomaly alert; malformed audio rejected with structured error; replay of same client-generated submission UUID is idempotent (returns same submission code, no duplicate WOs); token revoke flips immediate (next submission rejected with 401); per-asset quarantine prevents future issuance. Endpoint never returns operational data — only a submission code. Forensic query returns the submission with structured + raw payload + AVA proposal lineage.
- **Predictive parts staging.** WO created with known asset + error category → AVA proposes correct part for 80%+ of seeded historical scenarios → reservation creates `parts_requisition` row + push notification delivered to stockroom workstation within 2s of WO creation → technician's mobile view shows "Part reserved in Bin B4" inside their existing session. If part unavailable, AVA flags reorder with cross-ref alternate. Stockroom can override AVA reservation (regulated-action: reason code required, logged).
- **Break-glass PHI (marquee).** Tech with biomed-grade role presses Break Glass on a clinical WO; reason code dropdown enforced; on confirm, `field_unmask_grants` row inserted + `signature_chains` row chained + `audit_logs` row written, all in one transaction; field reveals on the WO for 10 minutes (configurable per asset class). At t=10min: worker auto-revokes, field re-masks on next render, audit row written. Forensic query: "every break-glass on this patient in last 90 days" returns the action with full provenance. **Negative tests:** (a) Tech without role pressing Break Glass → 403 with explainability (which role is required). (b) Tech with role pressing Break Glass on a property with `break_glass_eligible = false` → 403 with structured error "Property is not break-glass-eligible" — grant NOT written. (c) Tech with role pressing Break Glass on a property with `confidentiality_class = sealed_investigation` (hard-deny class) → 403 with structured error "Property is hard-denied; no grant possible" regardless of role; grant NOT written; audit row records the rejected attempt. (d) Same negative test for `confidentiality_class = unrelated_patient_context`. (e) Validator refuses publish of a property that sets `break_glass_eligible = true` AND `confidentiality_class = legal_hold` (mutually exclusive per §3.10).
- **Glove-Mode swipe UX (technician superpower).** Golden tests: `<SwipeProgressCard>` swipe-right invokes the same state-transition action on web (drag-right) and mobile (swipe-right); Detox + Playwright assertions verify both render identical state changes; `<ThumbToggle>` tap zone measures ≥ 44dp on web and ≥ 64dp on mobile per accessibility minimum. Visual regression captures gesture affordances.
- **Generative close-out (technician superpower).** Tech voice input on mobile → AVA produces structured close-out (resolution narrative + reason codes + parts log) → renders in mobile review pane → tech swipes-right-to-approve → e-signature row in `signature_chains`. Golden-test corpus: 50 representative voice inputs per overlay (clinical, facilities), AVA-generated reason codes must match the human-labeled gold set ≥ 95%. Failures route to AVA Code Assistant retraining backlog.
- **Dirty Nameplate Vision (technician superpower).** Test corpus: 100 nameplate photos (clean, scratched, dim, partially-occluded) with known asset ground truth. AVA Vision must return correct asset at confidence > 90% on ≥ 80% of photos; surface candidate list at 70-90% confidence on the remaining gradients; fall back to barcode/manual below 70%. False positives (high-confidence wrong asset) must be 0 in the corpus — this is a clinical safety boundary, not a quality target.
- **Elevator Mode (technician superpower).** Mobile app in simulated airplane-mode end-to-end: open WO, swipe-progress through states, complete checklist with thumb-toggles, capture nameplate photo, voice close-out, e-sign. Every step UI-responds in <16ms (measured via React DevTools profiler). On reconnect, sync replays all changes in order; conflict resolution per §3.7 policy; no data loss verified by post-sync DB query matching the offline-captured intent log.
- **P2P parts locator (connected-network).** Seed 3 technicians with cart stock of part X; one tech opens WO and taps "Find Part"; AVA returns ranked list including stockroom + 2 peer holders ordered by proximity; tap-ping creates in-app notification on holder's phone; accept → `parts_requisition` row with `source = peer_transfer`; decline → next candidate. Privacy: technician with `technician_presence.available_for_assist = false` does NOT appear in results. Audit: every ping + accept/decline logged in `audit_logs`.
- **Tribal-knowledge asset pins (connected-network).** Voice note on asset → AVA transcribes + indexes; junior tech opens same asset later → AVA proactive notification surfaces the pin within 500ms of asset detail render; tap plays voice + shows transcript; downvote removes from proactive surfacing for that user; moderation flag routes to Maintenance Manager workspace for review.
- **Floor-plan routing (connected-network).** Test corpus: 20 WO/location pairs in a synthetic hospital CAD/IFC dataset. `<FloorPlanRouter>` returns highlighted path for 95%+ of pairs within 2s; offline-cached for the technician's assigned wing; graph-validation pass at pack-install detects orphan nodes (door with no connected corridor) and refuses publish.
- **Smart LOTO vision verification (connected-network + regulated).** `permit_to_work` carries a customer-defined energy-control procedure under OSHA 1910.147 (5-step example used in this verification); `<LotoStepRunner>` enforces order; each step requires photo + AVA Vision verdict; vision-confidence < 70% → step blocked with structured error (never auto-advanced); 70-90% → tech asked to retake or attest; > 90% → step accepted, `loto_step_check` written, `signature_chains` extended. Full sequence completion writes a "Procedure Complete" signature; auditor can replay every lock photo + every verdict on demand.
- **Auditor Kiosk session (systemic differentiator).** Compliance Officer creates a kiosk session bound to a device fingerprint; auditor's iPad lands on `ws_auditor_kiosk`; every API call carries `aud='kiosk'`; ANY write attempt (POST/PUT/DELETE) returns 403 with structured "kiosk audience is read-only" regardless of role; revoke-in-one-tap kills the session immediately; expired session 401s with "Audit session ended"; full provenance in `audit_logs` + `signature_chains` of who issued, who used (device fingerprint), what was viewed.
- **Zero-login contractor flow (systemic differentiator).** Magic-link issued for one WO with `permitted_actions=['view','attach_photo','add_notes','sign_closeout']`; contractor receives SMS, taps, lands on `<ContractorPortal>`; can view + photo + note + sign; cannot navigate to other WOs (URL hacks → 403); single-use consumption stamps `consumed_at` on first redemption; subsequent attempt → 401 with "Link already used"; full audit trail of every action.
- **Smart Sprint batching (systemic differentiator).** Seed 12 WOs across 4 floors + 6 PMs due in next 14 days; AVA proposes 3 Sprints for 3 dispatchers; verify each Sprint maximizes floor-locality and pulls in 1-2 PMs that share a floor; dispatcher can edit/decline; approved Sprint creates `dispatch_assignment` rows; Sprint never auto-applied without dispatcher confirm.
- **Replacement-urgency score (systemic differentiator).** Seed 50 assets with varying repair-cost / downtime / sentiment profiles; AVA produces ranked urgency scores; top 5 match human-judged "obvious replace" set; each score's provenance card shows the underlying numbers + 3 quoted close-out narratives that drove the sentiment. Maintenance Manager sign-off required before score forwards to Finance dashboard.
- **Pivot-Kanban (visualization #18).** Seed 1000 WOs across 3 floors × 4 skill categories × 5 states. Pivot the board through all 5 column groupings (state, floor, skill, asset-category, priority); each pivot returns rendered DOM within 200ms on the demo dataset. Drag a WO from "Plumbing" to "Electrical" → AVA macro fires; WO re-assigned to electrician; categorization updated; audit row written; UI reflects within projection lag.
- **Dual-Axis Timeline (visualization #19).** Seed 20 technicians + 15 critical assets with realistic shift + downtime-window data; load 30 PMs into the timeline. Drag a PM block across the canvas; AVA highlights valid green intersections within 100ms of drag-event; snap-on-release writes `dispatch_assignment` row; invalid intersections (tech off-shift, asset in surgery) refuse the drop with structured "Not available" tooltip.
- **Triage Deck (visualization #20).** Seed 50 unassigned WOs; dispatcher uses keyboard only (no mouse) — Right/Left/Up/Down/Number keys; measure total time to clear all 50; assert ≤ 3 minutes (target 2 minutes). Each acceptance writes `dispatch_assignment`; each rejection re-queues. Accessibility: full keyboard navigation, ARIA labels per card, screen-reader narrates current WO summary.
- **Live Command Map (visualization #21).** Seed a synthetic CAD/IFC dataset for a 4-floor 200k-sqft hospital; 100 WOs distributed; 12 technicians with presence pings. Map renders at 60fps (Chrome perf trace); lasso-select 15 clustered WOs in one gesture, drag onto a technician's blue dot → creates "Major Incident" `dispatch_plan` with 15 assignment rows in one transaction. Privacy gate: technicians with `available_for_assist = false` rendered as gray (not droppable); their identity hidden from non-managers.
- **Dependency Graph (visualization #22).** Seed 25 WOs with 30 dependency edges across 3 trades; AVA computes critical path within 500ms; bottleneck WO badged with the AVA-generated explanation; clicking the bottleneck shows the 3 blocked downstream WOs + their priority + their SLA breach time. Reordering by dragging an edge updates the critical path live.
- **Active Entitlement Shield (#23 category-reset).** Drop a 50-page Philips vendor PDF onto `master_service_agreement` create-screen → AVA extracts SLA classes + covered components + response times + exclusions; structured payload renders for review; AP approves. Create a synthetic MRI WO → dispatcher sees the warranty-routing prompt; one-tap routes via §3.11 magic-link to the vendor; vendor completes work + e-signs → WO closes with `source = vendor_warranty_routed`. Negative: WO on a non-covered asset shows no prompt.
- **Live Operational Canvas (#24 category-reset).** Seed a synthetic 4-floor hospital CAD; load 8 PMs on Floor 3 for one tech; `<LiveOperationalCanvas>` renders with WebGL at 60fps + AVA-plotted walking path between rooms minimizing travel time + estimated total time. Wi-Fi beacon adapter (`wifi-beacon-occupancy`) emits a 24-hour synthetic occupancy trace; `occupancy_log` materializes; per-room heatmap renders aggregated by 5-min bucket; **no per-individual tracking surface in any view** (privacy verification).
- **Continuous Observations Engine (#25 category-reset).** Run a 50-fire-extinguisher round in the mobile swipe-deck (`<RoundsRunner>` Glove-Mode Rapid Fire); time elapsed ≤ 90s for 49 passes + 1 fail; **DB verification: exactly 50 `observations` rows + exactly 1 reactive `maintenance_work_order` row + ZERO additional WO rows** (the failure case). Trigger a synthetic failure-trend (3 brand-X beds fail bed-rail this week) → AVA Dynamic Smart Rounds injects a mandatory bed-rail check into tomorrow's room-round template for techs on the affected floors.
- **Network-to-Physical Triage + Quarantine Lockout (#26 category-reset).** Inject a Medigate vulnerability for an infusion pump that has a PM scheduled in 5 days → AVA Convergence Routing surfaces the merge proposal to OT Security Officer → approve → vulnerability ticket auto-closes-as-merged + PM checklist gains the patch-install step. Separately inject a critical CVE with exploit signature → quarantine workflow requires Security Officer + Maintenance Manager dual-confirmation + asset-criticality precheck → on confirm, `nac-quarantine` adapter fires (recorded in `outbound_call_log`), asset status flips to `quarantined`, clinical mobile shows "Do Not Use" banner; revoke (rollback) succeeds within 10s.
- **Predictive TCO Active Intercept (#27 back-office).** Synthetic 10-year-old ultrasound with cumulative repair cost = $14,000 + replacement cost = $20,000 + recent close-out narratives sentiment-tagged negative. Technician opens parts catalog and tries to order a $4,000 controller board → dialog interrupts with provenance card (TCO ratio = 65%, ratio threshold = 60%); accept-intercept → `capital_replacement_request` row created + Maintenance Manager notified; reject-and-order → `purchase_order` row created with `override_reason_code`. §3.16 separation-of-duties enforced on the capital-request approval path.
- **Autonomous JIT Procurement (#28 back-office).** Seed 30 days of `pm_schedule` + `parts_consumption` history. AVA emits 3 `procurement_proposal` rows next morning, one per major supplier; each line carries provenance (which PMs + which historical failures drove the qty). Procurement Manager reviews on `<ProcurementProposalCart>` and one-tap approves all → 3 `purchase_order` rows created with `source = ava_jit_proposal`. Budget envelope (§3.16) check verified: a proposal that would breach the quarterly budget refused with structured error + alternate-suggestion (cut by 20% / split across quarter / increase budget request).
- **AI-Enforced Vendor Invoice Reconciliation (#29 back-office).** Vendor drops a PDF invoice through the §3.11 magic-link portal; AVA Document AI extracts billed hours (4h) + rate ($150/h) + parts; reconciliation engine cross-references against actual time_on_site from `technician_presence` (2h) + `master_service_agreement` rate ($150/h matches) + `parts_consumption` (matches). **Mismatch detected: 4h billed vs 2h on-site** → `invoice_discrepancy` flag + workflow routes to discrepancy_review → AP supervisor sees a reason-coded variance + AVA's evidence summary + one-tap approve-with-variance or reject. Fraud-flagged invoices NEVER reach AP auto-approve.
- **Fleet-as-Asset (#30 back-office).** Seed a fire-rescue truck as `asset_type = 'vehicle'`; OBD2 telematics feed (`obd2-telematics-feed`) streams mileage + GPS into §3.5 `observation_streams`. PM schedule with utilization-trigger at 5,000 mi → idempotent `maintenance_work_order` fires when mileage crosses threshold; double-trigger refused by `generation_runs.idempotency_key` unique. Fault-code threshold rule fires → reactive WO with AVA-suggested fix per #4 Predictive Parts Staging.
- **Semantic Recall Quarantine (#31 edge-reset).** Feed in a synthetic FDA recall notice naming "Philips Model X". Seed an asset registry with deliberately messy data ("Philps Mod-X", "Phillips M-X", "Philips MX-2026", "Philips X Model"). AVA semantic match returns 4 matches at confidence ≥ 0.85; auto-tag with "Do Not Use" + biomed-dispatch fires. Negative: a "Philips Model Y" asset (different model) returns confidence 0.40 — surfaces for review, no auto-tag. **FDA precision/recall corpus** test runs against last-quarter ECRI feed; recall ≥ 95% on a hand-labeled ground-truth set is the gate.
- **Analyzer Blast Radius (#32 edge-reset).** Seed 500 patient-monitor calibration `inspection` rows pointing to a single Fluke Analyzer over 6 months (via §3.15 `relationship_edge` from calibrations to instruments). Mark the Fluke as out-of-tolerance → one-tap "Compute Blast Radius" in `<AnalyzerBlastRadiusBoard>` returns all 500 affected monitors within 2s; bulk action suspends clinical status on all of them + spawns 500 reactive `maintenance_work_order` rows. Verify no monitor is missed by cross-checking against the raw `inspection` table.
- **AVA Auto-Commissioning (#33 edge-reset).** Drag a synthetic 5,000-row messy contractor spreadsheet (deliberate typos, mixed naming conventions, varied location refs) into `<AssetImportWizard>`. AVA ingests + normalizes within 10 minutes → `import_batch` populated with per-row confidence + AVA explanations. Facilities Manager reviews on the grid; high-confidence rows (≥ 0.95) auto-accept-all option; med-confidence (0.80-0.95) one-tap-confirm-each; low-confidence (< 0.80) routed to AVA-edit-with-reviewer-followup. Atomic publish creates 5,000 `asset` rows in one transaction; rollback within 24h reverses.
- **Joint Commission EoC Merkle Proof (#34 edge-reset).** Auditor's iPad in `ws_auditor_kiosk` session. Auditor taps a room on Live Command Map → workspace renders every PM + inspection done in that room in the audit window (default last 365 days). Each row shows its `signature_chain_id` + Merkle root hash + ability to drill-down to the signed payload + signer's identity snapshot. Spot-check: tamper one inspection row in the source table → the chain re-verification at audit-export time detects the tamper + the audit-export flags the integrity failure.
- **Cryptographic Key Custody (#35 edge-reset).** Issue a master key to an employee via `<KeyCustodyLedger>`; e-sign by holder + supervisor co-sign required + `signature_chain_id` chains the transfer. Transition the employee's HR record to `terminated` (synthetic event) → automation fires `key_revocation_on_termination` → every open `key_assignment` for that user emits `unrecovered_key_flag` + recovery WO; Security Officer's workspace surfaces the recovery queue. Audit query: "every master-key transfer this quarter with signer identity + reason code" returns the expected rows in under 1s.

### 10.2 Pack-level (Phase 2-4 acceptance)
- **maintenance-core:** All 43 collections publish cleanly; reference-checker (W2.A) blocks delete of property referenced by automation rule or view; 9 OOTB workspaces render in both web and mobile; PM generator produces correct WOs against 1000-asset fixture; **rounds:** Batch Observation Session test — 50-extinguisher fire-safety round in mobile swipe-deck (#25 Glove-Mode Rapid Fire) → 50 `observations` rows written, 0 WO rows; one failure injected → exactly 1 reactive `maintenance_work_order` spawned; smart-rounds dynamic-injection rule verified against a synthetic failure-trend dataset; **contracts:** `master_service_agreement` renewal cycle fires at T-90/T-30/T-7 days; vendor scorecard recomputes on every WO close-out.
- **Three overlays installed together:** No schema collision; no role/view leakage between clinical, facilities, and OT security; pack-install upgrade validator passes.
- **clinical-maintenance:** UDI lookup against FDA fixture; calibration sign-off requires WebAuthn re-auth; ECRI advisory ingest creates `recall_response` records correctly.
- **facilities-maintenance:** BACnet adapter reads from mock device; refrigerant leak workflow generates EPA report draft; FCA assessment cycle produces deficiency log + remediation WO; **space management:** concurrent `space_reservation` requests on same space + overlapping window → conflict resolution workflow fires + alternate suggestion offered; `move_request` workflow advances through approval chain; `occupancy_log` partitions roll monthly via pg_partman.
- **ot-security-maintenance:** Claroty / Medigate / Asimily feeds ingest into `discovery_event` and map to existing assets; `ot_asset_vulnerability` taskable surfaces in `ws_ot_security_officer`; vulnerability_response workflow advances through triage → mitigation → e-sign → mitigated; `risk_score` recomputes on advisory ingest.

### 10.3 Pilot acceptance (Full Showcase — G6 close, ~week 44)
- **Mobile speed:** 60fps list scroll + sub-1s WO open on mid-range Android in a **hospital dead-zone / MRI-adjacent approved test area** with intermittent connectivity. Filmed comparison vs Nuvolo on the same device.
- **UI Builder dog-food:** Live edit a Technician workspace in the demo, save, reload — change persists, no downtime, no schema drift.
- **AVA voice WO marquee:** Demonstrated on stage. Technician dictates → AVA structures → one-tap submit → WO appears in Dispatcher workspace within projection lag (<1s).
- **Upgrade safety:** Run upgrade-validator against demo customer pack manifest; green result for compatible change; red result with precise fix instructions for incompatible change.
- **Compliance:** Produce a single attestation file for one asset's lifetime, verifiable hash chain end-to-end.

### 10.4 G6 scale acceptance (inside the Full Showcase Pilot — week 44)
- `apps/scale-rig` produces 3M assets, 20M WOs, archived history, **≤10B observation partitions** (within vanilla-PG + pg_partman comfort per §3.5; TimescaleDB triggered above this).
- Hot list views stay snapshot-backed (no full-table scan in EXPLAIN plan); circuit breaker holds under burst.
- Mobile selective-sync pulls < 1MB **of metadata + list payload** for a single technician's day; photos, audio recordings, service manuals, and evidence artifacts lazy-fetch on explicit user action (tap-to-load), not via background sync.
- Rollup-refresh lag stays under target across all granularities (hourly ≤ 5 min, daily ≤ 1 hour, weekly ≤ 1 day).
- Perf baseline frozen in `docs/scale-baselines/v1.json`.
- On-site mobile field test in a **hospital dead-zone / MRI-adjacent approved test area** (intermittent connectivity) — Elevator Mode acceptance contract holds.
- Regulator-export rehearsal validates against **HubbleWave attestation schema mapped to Part 11 controls + Joint Commission readiness rubric** (the platform delivers a Part 11-ready control envelope; full Part 11 compliance is a customer-operational determination).

## 11. Closed Questions (resolved during architectural review)

The 6 questions originally open are all closed by the review pass. Recorded here for traceability.

1. **Pilot timeline.** RESOLVED: pilot rebaselined as **Full Showcase, ~36-44 weeks**. Both Clinical AND Facilities overlays + all 22 differentiators + full substrate + scale verification all in scope. Phase gates G0a → G6 (§5.3) prevent giant-final-integration risk. No cut list — the architecture is honest about being a category-defining build, not an MVP slice.
2. **Training infrastructure (post-G6 only).** RESOLVED: self-hosted Ollama for inference + dedicated single-tenant SageMaker (or equivalent) for training. Multi-tenant managed ML services violate canon §5 instance isolation when handling PHI. Post-showcase work per §5.2.
3. **TimescaleDB stance.** RESOLVED: adopt **pg_partman Day-1** for partition management; rollups via **explicit SQL rollup tables + scheduled upsert jobs** (NOT pg_ivm — its README requires non-partitioned base tables and its immediate-maintenance mode degrades under high-volume writes). TimescaleDB stays a deferred escape valve for >10B observations/instance; G6 scale rig caps at ≤10B observations to stay within vanilla-PG comfort. Node-side rollup computation rejected. Reflected in §3.5 + §8 §31 amendment.
4. **Pack delivery channel.** RESOLVED: introduce a **Verified Pack Registry** using the standard install pipeline but enforcing a cryptographic signature check against the registry's signing key. Prevents customer packs from hijacking platform-reserved namespaces (e.g., a malicious customer pack named `maintenance-core`). Reflected in §8 §17.5 amendment.
5. **Cross-overlay GxP scope.** RESOLVED: `regulated-action` is a platform capability available to every overlay. Clinical (FDA), Facilities (EPA), and OT Security (CVE remediation evidence) all require immutable ledgers. Confirms the §3.6 + §4.5 design.
6. **Worker process scaling.** RESOLVED: single worker per instance is a SPOF. Introduce **Redis Consumer Groups (at-least-once delivery)** + **effectively-once processing** via idempotent consumers (unique `event_id` + `processed_events` ledger + idempotent UPSERTs + retry-safe tombstones; processed_events insert and domain mutation occur in the same DB transaction; Redis XACK only after commit). Canon §19 amended (see §8 amendments table). Reflected in §3.2 + §9.

## 11.1 New open questions surfaced by the review + differentiator pass

1. **Per-gate slip budget.** Each gate G0a → G6 has a target week. What's the slip-budget policy (e.g., ≤ 2 weeks of slip per gate before re-baseline) and what triggers a forced re-baseline (e.g., G3 slips 4 weeks → re-baseline the remaining 3 gates)? Proposal: 2 weeks per gate; cumulative budget capped at 6 weeks before mandatory re-baseline.
2. **Verified Pack Registry signing-key custody.** Is the registry signed by a HubbleWave root key (single key, cross-customer trust), or per-customer keys, or a hybrid (HubbleWave root + delegated partner publishers)?
3. **Ollama vs SageMaker boundary (post-G6).** Is inference always on-instance via Ollama, or are there inference patterns that route to single-tenant SageMaker endpoints (e.g., large-context document AI for service manuals)? Needs post-G6 spec.
4. **Break-glass eligibility policy.** Who can break-glass on what, and bound by what? Default proposal: role-eligibility (`biomed_technician`, `clinical_engineer`, `facility_manager`) × asset-category × pack-defined reason-code vocabulary × maximum 10-min duration. Per-customer policy override? Hospital ethics board approval for the bound set?
5. **AVA UI synthesis trust graduation.** Each synthesis feature defaults to Suggest mode (canon §12). What's the evidence threshold to graduate to direct-render? Proposal: 100+ accepted syntheses, 95%+ acceptance rate, zero validator rejections — then promote per-feature via the existing canon §12 trust progression rail.
6. **Public intake QR rotation policy.** Does an asset's QR token rotate (e.g., quarterly) or persist for the asset's lifetime? Lifetime is simpler for facilities staff; rotation is more secure but requires re-labeling. Proposal: lifetime by default; rotation triggered on token-revoke + automatic for assets with active grants.
7. **Predictive parts staging fallback.** If AVA cannot suggest a part (low confidence, no history), what's the default? Proposal: WO ships without staged part; technician's mobile view shows "AVA could not auto-stage parts; tap to browse catalog"; clean no-magic fallback rather than a wrong suggestion.
8. **AVA Vision model selection.** Per-customer trained vs generic CV model for nameplate OCR? Generic model is faster to ship; per-customer trained becomes valuable for unusual equipment (custom-engraved nameplates, manufacturer-specific layouts). Proposal: v1 generic OCR + asset-registry fuzzy match; per-customer fine-tuning post-G6 if metric corpus shows < 80% accuracy on the customer's mix.
9. **UI primitive evolution policy.** When does a new primitive land in the `@hubblewave/ui-primitives` vocabulary (canon §33 commitment, web+mobile rendering symmetry) vs ship in a customer plugin? Proposal: primitive lands in vocabulary only when (a) used by 2+ verticals OR by core platform, AND (b) has a clear semantic-equivalence contract across web + mobile. Otherwise stays in `@hubblewave/maintenance-plugins` or customer pack.
10. **Technician presence privacy policy.** Location/presence tracking of a workforce is labor-ethics territory and a likely sticking point in unionized hospital deployments. Proposal: opt-in per technician at first login; "Go Invisible" toggle in the mobile profile that keeps the tech outside `<PartFinder>` results without disabling pings to them; clear retention policy (presence pings deleted after 30 days); customer-admin policy override for organizations that require always-on tracking, documented in onboarding.
11. **Asset-pin moderation model.** Voice notes are user-generated content on a clinical/operations asset. Proposal: lightweight social moderation (downvote, flag-as-incorrect, flag-as-unsafe); AVA pre-screens for hostile language or PHI leakage at transcribe time and refuses to publish flagged content; pins flagged for "unsafe" route to Maintenance Manager workspace for review/delete; pins above N upvotes promoted to formal Knowledge Base article via AVA-drafted PR.
12. **Smart LOTO vision-failure escalation.** If AVA Vision cannot confirm a lock placement at any step, the workflow blocks (fail-safe-block, never fail-safe-allow per OSHA). Default escalation: technician can attest manually with a reason code + photo + supervisor co-sign (regulated-action), which captures full provenance. Open: should attestation require remote-witnessed sign-off (supervisor receives push, watches a 10-sec video, co-signs from their phone), or is the reason-code-and-photo trail sufficient?
13. **Kiosk device-fingerprint policy.** What constitutes a device fingerprint robust enough for kiosk binding? Proposal: WebAuthn-style platform-attestation key registered at kiosk-session-start; rotating the iPad voids the session and forces re-issue. Plus second-factor: Compliance Officer's confirmation tap on their phone when the iPad presents the session for the first time.
14. **Magic-link contractor link delivery + rate-limit.** SMS vs email vs both? Proposal: customer-admin choice; deliverability matters more in the field than precision; default to BOTH with deduplication on first redemption. Rate-limit: 3 redemption attempts before token revocation (anti-brute-force).
15. **Smart Sprint dispatcher autonomy.** AVA proposes; dispatcher approves. But what about dispatch-shift handoffs — does the next dispatcher inherit the previous dispatcher's approved Sprint or restart? Proposal: Sprint persists until completion or dispatcher manual cancel; shift handoff transfers ownership; AVA can suggest re-batching only on Sprint completion.
16. **Replacement-urgency score forwarding policy.** When does a high-urgency score forward from Maintenance Manager → Finance? Proposal: Maintenance Manager reviews on a weekly cadence; explicit "Forward to Finance" action writes a signature_chains row + emits a notification to Finance Director persona. Never auto-forwarded; always human-gated.
17. **Live Command Map technician-tracking source-of-truth.** Wi-Fi triangulation vs Bluetooth-beacon mesh vs mobile-device GPS vs manual check-in. Proposal: customer-admin choice per facility, default to opt-in mobile GPS for outdoor + Wi-Fi triangulation indoors; staleness threshold 60s renders as "last known"; data retention 24h then aggregate-only for trend analytics.
18. **Pivot-Kanban macro behavior policy.** Which column transitions fire which AVA macros? Proposal: pack-author declares macro bindings in pack manifest (`pivot_kanban.column_transitions[]`); platform default is "no-op + audit"; customers customize via UI Builder; critical-priority WOs require confirm-on-drop; 5-second undo affordance on every drag.
19. **Lasso-and-drag UX accessibility on Command Map.** Lasso is mouse/touch-only. Keyboard-only operators need an alternative. Proposal: ship a keyboard-driven "select by criteria" modal (floor + priority + age) that yields the same multi-WO assignment outcome; same audit row; same UX endpoint.

## 13. Implementation Plan (concrete artifact-level spec — to be filled in per substrate section + pack module before code starts)

### 13.1 Implementation-plan structure

Every substrate section (§3.1-§3.18), every pack collection (51 core + 12 clinical + 14 facilities + 6 OT security = 83), every workflow, and every marquee follows the **same artifact template**:

1. **Tables** — every new table with: schema, name, every column (name, Postgres type, default, NOT NULL / NULLABLE, FK references); every index (including partial indexes + composite indexes); partition strategy if applicable; row-level security policies if applicable.
2. **Migrations** — every migration file with: filename (UTC-timestamp prefix per HubbleWave convention), contents sketch (DDL statements), `CONCURRENTLY` flag where needed per Plan Fix 26.
3. **TypeORM entities** — entity class name, area file (`libs/instance-db/src/lib/entities/<area>.entity.ts`), every decorator, every relation.
4. **Services + ports** — every service class, method signatures, port interfaces, DI bindings.
5. **API endpoints** — every route (path + HTTP method), auth requirements (`@Public` / `@Roles` / `@AllowServiceToken` / `@RequireServiceScope`), request schema, response schema, status codes.
6. **Validator extensions** — what publish gate fails and with which structured error.
7. **Service-boundary scanner rules** — which paths may write which tables; entries for `tools/service-boundary-check.ts`.
8. **Workflows** — state-machine diagram with states + transitions + guards + actions.
9. **Tests** — unit, integration, self-test, edge-case verification assertions (every test target named).
10. **PR breakdown** — ordered list of PRs with goal, files touched, acceptance criteria, dependencies.
11. **Canon amendment text** — exact wording to land in `CLAUDE.md`.

### 13.2 Worked example: §3.1 Taskable Capability (complete artifact-level spec — template for the other 17 substrate sections)

#### 13.2.1 Tables

**`metadata.taskable_capabilities`** — one row per opted-in collection.

| Column | Type | Default | Nullable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | `uuid` | `gen_random_uuid()` | NOT NULL | Primary key |
| `collection_id` | `uuid` | — | NOT NULL | FK → `metadata.collection_definitions(id)`; UNIQUE |
| `task_kind` | `varchar(64)` | — | NOT NULL | e.g. `maintenance_work_order`, `inspection`, `calibration`, `permit_to_work` |
| `field_mapping` | `jsonb` | `'{}'::jsonb` | NOT NULL | Semantic-name → propertyId map: `{"number": "<uuid>", "title": "<uuid>", "state": "<uuid>", "priority": "<uuid>", "assigned_to": "<uuid>", "assigned_group": "<uuid>", "requested_by": "<uuid>", "due_at": "<uuid>", "opened_at": "<uuid>", "closed_at": "<uuid>", "sla_breach_at": "<uuid>"}` |
| `lifecycle_state_machine_id` | `uuid` | — | NULL | FK → `automation.state_machine_definitions(id)` |
| `timeline_enabled` | `boolean` | `false` | NOT NULL | — |
| `approvals_enabled` | `boolean` | `false` | NOT NULL | — |
| `projection_enabled` | `boolean` | `true` | NOT NULL | When `true`, source events emit to `instance_event_outbox` for §3.2 task_projection consumer |
| `priority_choice_list_id` | `uuid` | — | NULL | FK → `metadata.choice_lists(id)` |
| `source` | `varchar(64)` | `'pack'` | NOT NULL | Provenance: `pack` / `customer` / `migration` |
| `created_at` | `timestamptz` | `now()` | NOT NULL | — |
| `updated_at` | `timestamptz` | `now()` | NOT NULL | Updated by trigger |

**Indexes:**
- `pk_taskable_capabilities` ON (`id`) — PK
- `ux_taskable_capabilities_collection_id` UNIQUE ON (`collection_id`)
- `ix_taskable_capabilities_task_kind` ON (`task_kind`)
- `ix_taskable_capabilities_source` ON (`source`)

**`metadata.taskable_required_fields`** — denormalized constraint rows so the metadata validator can fail fast.

| Column | Type | Default | Nullable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | `uuid` | `gen_random_uuid()` | NOT NULL | PK |
| `capability_id` | `uuid` | — | NOT NULL | FK → `taskable_capabilities(id)` ON DELETE CASCADE |
| `semantic_name` | `varchar(64)` | — | NOT NULL | One of: `number`, `title`, `state`, `priority`, `assigned_to`, `assigned_group`, `requested_by`, `due_at`, `opened_at`, `closed_at`, `sla_breach_at` |
| `required` | `boolean` | `true` | NOT NULL | — |
| `expected_type` | `varchar(32)` | — | NOT NULL | One of: `text`, `uuid`, `timestamptz`, `int`, `enum_via_choice_list` |
| `created_at` | `timestamptz` | `now()` | NOT NULL | — |

**Indexes:**
- `pk_taskable_required_fields` ON (`id`)
- `ux_taskable_required_fields_capability_semantic` UNIQUE ON (`capability_id`, `semantic_name`)
- `ix_taskable_required_fields_capability_id` ON (`capability_id`)

#### 13.2.2 Migrations

**`libs/instance-db/src/lib/migrations/1937000000000-add-taskable-capabilities.ts`** (instance-DB, runs after Phase 0 amendments land):

```typescript
import { MigrationInterface, QueryRunner } from 'typeorm';

export class AddTaskableCapabilities1937000000000 implements MigrationInterface {
  name = 'AddTaskableCapabilities1937000000000';

  public async up(qr: QueryRunner): Promise<void> {
    await qr.query(`CREATE TABLE metadata.taskable_capabilities (
      id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
      collection_id uuid NOT NULL UNIQUE REFERENCES metadata.collection_definitions(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
      task_kind varchar(64) NOT NULL,
      field_mapping jsonb NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb,
      lifecycle_state_machine_id uuid REFERENCES automation.state_machine_definitions(id),
      timeline_enabled boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
      approvals_enabled boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
      projection_enabled boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT true,
      priority_choice_list_id uuid REFERENCES metadata.choice_lists(id),
      source varchar(64) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pack',
      created_at timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
      updated_at timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
    )`);
    await qr.query(`CREATE INDEX ix_taskable_capabilities_task_kind ON metadata.taskable_capabilities(task_kind)`);
    await qr.query(`CREATE INDEX ix_taskable_capabilities_source ON metadata.taskable_capabilities(source)`);

    await qr.query(`CREATE TABLE metadata.taskable_required_fields (
      id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
      capability_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES metadata.taskable_capabilities(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
      semantic_name varchar(64) NOT NULL,
      required boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT true,
      expected_type varchar(32) NOT NULL,
      created_at timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
      UNIQUE (capability_id, semantic_name)
    )`);
    await qr.query(`CREATE INDEX ix_taskable_required_fields_capability_id ON metadata.taskable_required_fields(capability_id)`);
  }

  public async down(qr: QueryRunner): Promise<void> {
    await qr.query(`DROP TABLE metadata.taskable_required_fields`);
    await qr.query(`DROP TABLE metadata.taskable_capabilities`);
  }
}
```

`CONCURRENTLY` not needed: tables are new + empty at creation.

#### 13.2.3 TypeORM entities

**File:** `libs/instance-db/src/lib/entities/capabilities.entity.ts` (NEW area file)

```typescript
import { Entity, PrimaryGeneratedColumn, Column, ManyToOne, OneToMany, JoinColumn, Index, Unique } from 'typeorm';
import { CollectionDefinition } from './metadata.entity';
import { StateMachineDefinition } from './automation.entity';
import { ChoiceList } from './metadata.entity';

@Entity({ schema: 'metadata', name: 'taskable_capabilities' })
@Unique(['collectionId'])
@Index(['taskKind'])
@Index(['source'])
export class TaskableCapability {
  @PrimaryGeneratedColumn('uuid') id: string;
  @Column('uuid', { name: 'collection_id' }) collectionId: string;
  @ManyToOne(() => CollectionDefinition) @JoinColumn({ name: 'collection_id' }) collection: CollectionDefinition;
  @Column('varchar', { length: 64, name: 'task_kind' }) taskKind: string;
  @Column('jsonb', { name: 'field_mapping', default: () => `'{}'::jsonb` }) fieldMapping: Record<string, string>;
  @Column('uuid', { name: 'lifecycle_state_machine_id', nullable: true }) lifecycleStateMachineId?: string;
  @ManyToOne(() => StateMachineDefinition) @JoinColumn({ name: 'lifecycle_state_machine_id' }) lifecycleStateMachine?: StateMachineDefinition;
  @Column('boolean', { name: 'timeline_enabled', default: false }) timelineEnabled: boolean;
  @Column('boolean', { name: 'approvals_enabled', default: false }) approvalsEnabled: boolean;
  @Column('boolean', { name: 'projection_enabled', default: true }) projectionEnabled: boolean;
  @Column('uuid', { name: 'priority_choice_list_id', nullable: true }) priorityChoiceListId?: string;
  @ManyToOne(() => ChoiceList) @JoinColumn({ name: 'priority_choice_list_id' }) priorityChoiceList?: ChoiceList;
  @Column('varchar', { length: 64, default: 'pack' }) source: string;
  @Column('timestamptz', { name: 'created_at', default: () => 'now()' }) createdAt: Date;
  @Column('timestamptz', { name: 'updated_at', default: () => 'now()' }) updatedAt: Date;
  @OneToMany(() => TaskableRequiredField, (rf) => rf.capability) requiredFields: TaskableRequiredField[];
}

@Entity({ schema: 'metadata', name: 'taskable_required_fields' })
@Unique(['capabilityId', 'semanticName'])
@Index(['capabilityId'])
export class TaskableRequiredField {
  @PrimaryGeneratedColumn('uuid') id: string;
  @Column('uuid', { name: 'capability_id' }) capabilityId: string;
  @ManyToOne(() => TaskableCapability, (tc) => tc.requiredFields, { onDelete: 'CASCADE' }) @JoinColumn({ name: 'capability_id' }) capability: TaskableCapability;
  @Column('varchar', { length: 64, name: 'semantic_name' }) semanticName: string;
  @Column('boolean', { default: true }) required: boolean;
  @Column('varchar', { length: 32, name: 'expected_type' }) expectedType: string;
  @Column('timestamptz', { name: 'created_at', default: () => 'now()' }) createdAt: Date;
}
```

**Index update:** `libs/instance-db/src/lib/entities/index.ts` — add new line `export * from './capabilities.entity';` and add `TaskableCapability` + `TaskableRequiredField` to the `instanceEntities` array.

#### 13.2.4 Services

**File:** `apps/api/src/app/metadata/capabilities/capability-registry.service.ts` (NEW)

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class CapabilityRegistryService {
  constructor(
    @InjectRepository(TaskableCapability) private readonly capRepo: Repository<TaskableCapability>,
    @InjectRepository(TaskableRequiredField) private readonly fieldRepo: Repository<TaskableRequiredField>,
    private readonly logger: Logger,
  ) {}

  async isTaskable(collectionId: string): Promise<boolean> {
    return (await this.capRepo.count({ where: { collectionId } })) > 0;
  }

  async getCapability(collectionId: string): Promise<TaskableCapability | null> {
    return this.capRepo.findOne({ where: { collectionId }, relations: ['requiredFields'] });
  }

  async registerCapability(input: RegisterTaskableInput, ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<TaskableCapability> {
    // Validates field_mapping against required fields; refuses if a required field is unmapped.
    // Writes via withAudit per canon §10.
  }

  async validateFieldMapping(capabilityId: string, mapping: Record<string, string>): Promise<ValidationResult> {
    // For each TaskableRequiredField with required=true: verify mapping has the semantic name AND
    // verify the mapped property's PropertyDefinition.type matches expected_type.
    // Returns structured ValidationResult with errors[] for the metadata validator.
  }
}

export interface RegisterTaskableInput {
  collectionId: string;
  taskKind: string;
  fieldMapping: Record<string, string>;
  lifecycleStateMachineId?: string;
  projectionEnabled?: boolean;
  source?: 'pack' | 'customer' | 'migration';
}
```

**File:** `apps/api/src/app/metadata/capabilities/capabilities.module.ts` (NEW) — module wiring + TypeOrmModule.forFeature([TaskableCapability, TaskableRequiredField]).

#### 13.2.5 API endpoints

| Method | Path | Auth | Request | Response | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/metadata/capabilities/taskable/:collectionId` | `@Roles('admin', 'metadata_admin')` | path param | `TaskableCapabilityDto` | 404 if not taskable |
| `POST` | `/metadata/capabilities/taskable` | `@Roles('admin', 'metadata_admin')` | `RegisterTaskableInput` | `TaskableCapabilityDto` | 409 if already registered |
| `PUT` | `/metadata/capabilities/taskable/:id` | `@Roles('admin', 'metadata_admin')` | `RegisterTaskableInput` | `TaskableCapabilityDto` | re-validates field_mapping |
| `DELETE` | `/metadata/capabilities/taskable/:id` | `@Roles('admin')` | — | 204 | Refuses if any pack has installed records that reference this capability — error structured per W2.A reference-checker pattern |
| `GET` | `/metadata/capabilities/required-fields/contract` | `@Public()` | — | `{ requiredFields: [{semantic_name, expected_type, required}] }` | Returns the global taskable contract (one of: number/title/state/priority/...) for pack authors to reference at build time. |

#### 13.2.6 Validator extension

Extend `apps/api/src/app/metadata/packs/pack-validator.service.ts`:

- New validator rule `TaskableFieldMappingComplete`: for every collection in the pack manifest that declares `taskable: true`, the `taskable_field_mapping` block must have entries for every `TaskableRequiredField.required = true` row, AND every entry must reference a property declared in the same pack's `properties[]`, AND that property's type must match `expected_type`.
- Refusal returns structured error: `{ kind: 'INCOMPLETE_TASKABLE_MAPPING', collection: '...', missing: ['state', 'priority'], type_mismatches: [{semantic_name: 'due_at', expected: 'timestamptz', actual: 'text'}] }`.

#### 13.2.7 Service-boundary scanner

Extend `tools/service-boundary-check.ts`:

```typescript
// New entries
'metadata.taskable_capabilities': {
  writers: ['apps/api/src/app/metadata/capabilities/**'],
  readers: ['apps/api/src/app/automation/**', 'apps/api/src/app/views/**', 'apps/api/src/app/data/**', 'apps/api/src/app/notifications/**', 'apps/api/src/app/ai/**', 'apps/worker/src/projections/**'],
},
'metadata.taskable_required_fields': {
  writers: ['apps/api/src/app/metadata/capabilities/**'],
  readers: ['apps/api/src/app/metadata/packs/**'],  // validator reads at publish
},
```

#### 13.2.8 Tests

**Self-test** (`tools/taskable-capability-check.ts.spec.ts` or co-located): grows to ≥ 10 assertions covering:

1. Registering a taskable capability with all required fields mapped → succeeds.
2. Missing `state` mapping → `validateFieldMapping` returns `INCOMPLETE_TASKABLE_MAPPING` with `missing: ['state']`.
3. Mapping `due_at` to a `text` property → returns `type_mismatches` with the expected vs actual.
4. Registering a second capability on the same collection → 409 conflict.
5. Deleting a capability that another pack's record references → 409 with reference list.
6. `isTaskable(collectionId)` returns true after registration, false before.
7. Re-registering with `source = 'pack'` after `source = 'customer'` is refused (pack cannot overwrite customer registration).
8. Validator catches a pack manifest that declares `taskable: true` without `taskable_field_mapping`.
9. `priority_choice_list_id` if present must reference an existing `ChoiceList`; missing FK refuses.
10. State-machine reference if present must be active; inactive state machine refuses.

**Integration tests** (`apps/api/test/integration/taskable-capability.spec.ts`): full HTTP-layer tests against a Postgres testcontainer.

**Canon scanner update**: `npm run authz:check`, `service-boundary:check`, `audit:check` all pass.

#### 13.2.9 PR breakdown for §3.1

| PR | Goal | Files | Acceptance |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 1 | Migration + entities | `libs/instance-db/src/lib/migrations/1937000000000-add-taskable-capabilities.ts`, `libs/instance-db/src/lib/entities/capabilities.entity.ts`, `libs/instance-db/src/lib/entities/index.ts` | Migration runs forward + backward; entities load in `instanceEntities` array; existing tests stay green. |
| 2 | Service + module + ports | `apps/api/src/app/metadata/capabilities/capability-registry.service.ts`, `capabilities.module.ts`; module imported in `MetadataModule` | Service injectable; `isTaskable()`, `getCapability()`, `registerCapability()`, `validateFieldMapping()` covered by unit tests. |
| 3 | API controllers | `apps/api/src/app/metadata/capabilities/capabilities.controller.ts` (CRUD endpoints) | Integration tests pass for all 5 endpoints; authz guards verified; W2.A reference-check on delete. |
| 4 | Validator + scanner | `apps/api/src/app/metadata/packs/pack-validator.service.ts` extension; `tools/service-boundary-check.ts` rules | Validator self-test ≥ 10 assertions; scanner self-test green; pack-publish negative test refuses incomplete mapping. |
| 5 | Canon amendment | `CLAUDE.md` §30 NEW: Capability Contracts | Canon merged; review checklist references it. |

**Total: 5 PRs for §3.1. Estimated effort: ~4-6 working days for one engineer + AI agents.**

### 13.3 Worked example: §3.2 Task Projection (full artifact-level spec — the largest substrate section)

#### 13.3.1 Tables

**`data.task_projection`** — denormalized projection of every active taskable record across all opted-in collections.

| Column | Type | Default | Nullable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | `uuid` | — | NOT NULL | = `source_record_id`; part of composite PK with `task_kind` |
| `source_collection_id` | `uuid` | — | NOT NULL | FK → `metadata.collection_definitions(id)` (NOT VALIDATED — projection lives outside the source schema) |
| `source_collection_code` | `varchar(120)` | — | NOT NULL | Denormalized for query speed; avoids join on every list query |
| `task_kind` | `varchar(64)` | — | NOT NULL | LIST partition key; values from `taskable_capabilities.task_kind` |
| `number` | `text` | — | NULL | Semantic field `number` mapped via `taskable_capabilities.field_mapping` |
| `title` | `text` | — | NULL | Semantic field `title` |
| `state` | `varchar(64)` | — | NOT NULL | Semantic field `state`; lifecycle position |
| `priority` | `smallint` | — | NULL | Derived from priority `ChoiceItem.order` for sort-stable ordering |
| `assigned_to` | `uuid` | — | NULL | User FK |
| `assigned_group` | `uuid` | — | NULL | Group FK |
| `requested_by` | `uuid` | — | NULL | User FK |
| `opened_at` | `timestamptz` | `now()` | NOT NULL | RANGE partition key (monthly) within each `task_kind` LIST partition |
| `due_at` | `timestamptz` | — | NULL | — |
| `closed_at` | `timestamptz` | — | NULL | NOT NULL on closed/cancelled rows |
| `sla_breach_at` | `timestamptz` | — | NULL | Computed at projection time from `sla_instance` |
| `customer_acl_hash` | `bytea(32)` | — | NULL | §28 cached principal-set signature for ACL pre-filter |
| `last_projected_at` | `timestamptz` | `now()` | NOT NULL | When this row was last upserted by consumer |
| `source_version` | `int` | — | NOT NULL | Row version on source record at projection time (stale detection) |
| `deleted_at` | `timestamptz` | — | NULL | Tombstone marker; rows kept N hours then GC'd |
| `attrs_jsonb` | `jsonb` | `'{}'::jsonb` | NOT NULL | Pack-declared chips; every key must appear in pack's `task_projection.attrs[]` schema per §3.2 |

**Partitioning strategy:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE data.task_projection (...) PARTITION BY LIST (task_kind);
-- Per task_kind:
CREATE TABLE data.task_projection_maintenance_work_order PARTITION OF data.task_projection
  FOR VALUES IN ('maintenance_work_order') PARTITION BY RANGE (opened_at);
-- pg_partman manages monthly sub-partitions of each LIST partition:
SELECT partman.create_parent(
  'data.task_projection_maintenance_work_order',
  'opened_at', 'native', 'monthly',
  p_premake := 3, p_start_partition := '2026-01-01'
);
```

**Indexes** (each per LIST sub-partition):
| Index | Columns / WHERE | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| PK | `(id, task_kind)` | Required composite due to LIST partitioning |
| `ix_assignee_state` | `(assigned_to, state) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL` | Technician's "my open work" |
| `ix_group_state` | `(assigned_group, state) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL` | Dispatcher queue |
| `ix_due_at` | `(due_at) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL AND closed_at IS NULL` | SLA queue |
| `ix_sla_breach_at` | `(sla_breach_at) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL AND closed_at IS NULL` | SLA escalation |
| `ix_acl_hash` | `(customer_acl_hash) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL` | §28 ACL bucket pre-filter |
| `ix_attrs_gin` | `GIN(attrs_jsonb)` | Pivot-Kanban / chip queries |
| `ix_source_record` | `(source_collection_id, id) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL` | Reconciler join key |

All indexes created `CONCURRENTLY` on populated partitions per Plan Fix 26.

**`data.task_projection_archive`** — identical schema; receives detached cold partitions (rows with `closed_at < now() - archive_age_months`) via the `partition-steward.job.ts` worker.

**`data.task_projection_lag`** — per-collection consumer cursor.

| Column | Type | Default | Nullable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `collection_id` | `uuid` | — | NOT NULL | PK |
| `task_kind` | `varchar(64)` | — | NOT NULL | Denormalized for ops dashboards |
| `last_outbox_seq` | `bigint` | `0` | NOT NULL | Last consumed `instance_event_outbox.seq` for this collection |
| `last_projected_at` | `timestamptz` | `now()` | NOT NULL | Wall-clock of last successful projection write |
| `lag_seconds` | `int` | `0` | NOT NULL | Trigger-computed from `(now() - last_projected_at)`; surfaces on Maintenance Manager workspace |
| `circuit_open_above_seconds` | `int` | `30` | NOT NULL | Per-kind override threshold for the circuit-breaker (§3.2) |
| `bucket_rebuilding` | `boolean` | `false` | NOT NULL | Set true during a §28 `CollectionAccessRule` invalidation rebuild |

Indexes: PK on `(collection_id)`; `ix_lag` on `(lag_seconds DESC)` for ops dashboards.

**`automation.processed_events`** — idempotency ledger for **all** worker consumers (not just task_projection).

| Column | Type | Default | Nullable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `consumer_name` | `varchar(120)` | — | NOT NULL | Part of PK; e.g. `task_projection_consumer`, `rollup_consumer`, `pm_generator` |
| `event_id` | `uuid` | — | NOT NULL | Part of PK; from `instance_event_outbox.event_id` |
| `received_at` | `timestamptz` | `now()` | NOT NULL | RANGE partition key (monthly via pg_partman) |
| `processed_at` | `timestamptz` | `now()` | NOT NULL | — |
| `outcome` | `varchar(32)` | `'applied'` | NOT NULL | `applied` / `skipped` / `error` |

**Partitioning:** `PARTITION BY RANGE (received_at)` monthly; pg_partman auto-creates next month + drops > 90 days.
**PK:** `(consumer_name, event_id)` — composite PK IS the idempotency check. `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` is the gate.

#### 13.3.2 Migrations

Files in `libs/instance-db/src/lib/migrations/`:

1. `1937100000000-add-task-projection.ts` — creates `data.task_projection` as LIST partitioned root + `data.task_projection_archive` + `data.task_projection_lag`. Does NOT create per-task_kind sub-partitions (those are added on `taskable_capability` insert via service code, not migration).
2. `1937100000001-add-processed-events.ts` — creates `automation.processed_events` partitioned root + initial 3 monthly partitions.
3. `1937100000002-add-task-projection-pg-partman-config.ts` — registers each task_kind's sub-partition with `partman.create_parent`. Calls are wrapped in `IF NOT EXISTS` patterns so re-run is safe.
4. `1937100000003-add-task-projection-indexes-concurrent.ts` — `static transaction = false`; creates indexes `CONCURRENTLY` per Plan Fix 26 (the empty initial state means CONCURRENT isn't strictly required, but the migration is forward-compatible with later non-empty re-runs).

Each migration file extends `MigrationInterface` with `up()` + `down()`. `down()` for #1 drops the tables; `down()` for #4 drops the indexes only.

#### 13.3.4 Services (worker + API)

**File:** `apps/worker/src/projections/task-projection/task-projection.consumer.ts` (NEW)

```

**File:** `apps/worker/src/projections/task-projection/task-projection.reconciler.ts` (NEW) — scheduled daily; diffs source ↔ projection per partition pair; emits missing/orphan/stale-by-version repair operations. Uses `ACCESS SHARE` lock only on active partitions.

**File:** `apps/api/src/app/views/list-reader.service.ts` (extends existing) — adds the circuit-breaker logic:

```typescript
async listTasks(query: ListQuery, ctx: RequestContext): Promise<ListResult> {
  const cap = await this.capabilityRegistry.getCapability(query.collectionId);
  if (!cap || !cap.projectionEnabled) throw new BadRequestException('Collection is not projection-enabled');

  const lag = await this.lagRepo.findOne({ where: { collectionId: query.collectionId } });
  if (lag && lag.lagSeconds > lag.circuitOpenAboveSeconds) {
    // CIRCUIT OPEN — serve stale + banner; DO NOT fallback to source on list endpoints
    return this.servStaleWithBanner(query, ctx, lag.lastProjectedAt);
  }

  // Normal path: §28 evaluator pre-filters via customer_acl_hash bucket
  const buckets = await this.authzService.getApplicableAclBuckets(query.collectionId, ctx);
  const candidates = await this.projectionRepo.find({
    where: { sourceCollectionId: query.collectionId, customerAclHash: In(buckets), deletedAt: IsNull() },
    take: query.limit, skip: query.offset,
  });
  // Final post-filter through centralized authz (the security gate)
  const visible = await this.authzService.applyRowConditions(candidates, ctx);
  // Field-masking on the projection-safe attrs
  return this.authzService.applyFieldMasking(visible, ctx);
}
```

#### 13.3.5 API endpoints

| Method | Path | Auth | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/views/:viewId/list` | `@Roles` per view | List endpoint (circuit-breaker gated) — returns `{ rows, totalCount, isStale, staleAsOf, bannerMessage? }` |
| `GET` | `/projection/:collectionId/lag` | `@Roles('maintenance_admin', 'ops')` | Operations endpoint — returns `task_projection_lag` row |
| `POST` | `/projection/:collectionId/rebuild` | `@Roles('platform_admin')` | Manual reconciler trigger for a single collection |
| `GET` | `/projection/:taskKind/_health` | `@AllowServiceToken @RequireServiceScope('projection:read')` | Internal health check for monitoring; returns lag + last-projected timestamp |

#### 13.3.6 Validator extensions

Pack publish validator (`apps/api/src/app/metadata/packs/pack-validator.service.ts`):

1. **Projection_safe attrs schema gate.** For every collection with `taskable_capabilities.projection_enabled = true`, the pack manifest must declare `task_projection.attrs[]` schema. Every attrs key has `projection_safe: true` AND `confidentiality_class ∈ {public, internal}`. Validator refuses publish with structured error if attrs key references a property whose `confidentiality_class` is `sensitive` / `never_reveal` / etc.
2. **Task_kind uniqueness gate.** No two pack-declared taskable collections may share the same `task_kind` value within the same instance. Validator refuses publish on conflict.
3. **field_mapping cross-pack collision.** If a collection's `field_mapping` references properties from another pack (e.g., a clinical overlay references a maintenance-core property), the pack-dependency graph must include that pack and the property must exist at publish-eval time.

#### 13.3.7 Service-boundary scanner rules

```typescript
// tools/service-boundary-check.ts entries
'data.task_projection': {
  writers: ['apps/worker/src/projections/task-projection/**'],
  readers: ['apps/api/src/app/views/**', 'apps/api/src/app/search/**', 'apps/api/src/app/ai/**'],
  /* No direct API-process writes — list endpoint is read-only on this table. */
},
'data.task_projection_archive': {
  writers: ['apps/worker/src/archive/partition-steward.job.ts'],
  readers: ['apps/api/src/app/archive/**'],
},
'data.task_projection_lag': {
  writers: ['apps/worker/src/projections/task-projection/**'],
  readers: ['apps/api/src/app/views/**', 'apps/api/src/app/ops/**'],
},
'automation.processed_events': {
  writers: ['apps/worker/src/projections/**', 'apps/worker/src/maintenance/**', 'apps/worker/src/observations/**'],
  readers: ['apps/api/src/app/ops/**'],
},
```

**Bulk-import bypass allowlist** (per §7 risk #1 mitigation): explicit allowlist entries in `service-boundary-check.ts` for `apps/api/src/app/import/bulk-import-projection-write.service.ts` to write `task_projection` rows in the same transaction as the source row, named with a comment explaining the architectural carve-out.

#### 13.3.8 Tests (self-test ≥ 15 assertions)

1. Insert a `taskable_capability` for a synthetic collection → consumer wakes → outbox row → projection upsert → row visible via list endpoint.
2. Duplicate delivery: send the same outbox event twice → `processed_events` insert succeeds first time, fails (ON CONFLICT) second time → `task_projection` upserted exactly once.
3. `record.delete` event → projection row gets `deleted_at` set → list endpoint excludes the row → archive partition steward later moves it.
4. `rule.invalidate` event → lag row's `bucket_rebuilding = true` → reconciler picks up affected rows → ACL bucket recomputed → `bucket_rebuilding` flips false on completion.
5. **Circuit breaker:** inject lag of 60s on one task_kind → list endpoint returns `isStale: true` + banner + serves last-projected rows → NO source-table queries fired (verified via DB query log).
6. **Single-record fallback:** circuit open → single-record fetch endpoint still queries source-table → returns the freshest data.
7. **Reconciler diff:** seed 100 source rows; delete 5 directly from projection; run reconciler → 5 missing-in-projection diff entries surfaced → reproject restores them.
8. **Reconciler ACCESS SHARE only:** during reconciler run, concurrent INSERTs into the source partition succeed without blocking (verified via pg_stat_activity).
9. **Bulk-import bypass:** 200k WO bulk import → projection rows + source rows written in same transaction via the allowlisted path → no queue saturation.
10. **Tombstone GC:** rows with `deleted_at < now() - 7 days` GC'd by partition steward; archive partition contains them.
11. **Partition steward:** closed rows older than `archive_age_months` (default 24) get detached from active partition + attached to archive.
12. **Projection_safe filtering:** an `attrs_jsonb` value containing a key not in the pack-declared schema is REJECTED at consumer write time + logged as RuntimeAnomaly.
13. **task_kind uniqueness:** publishing a second pack with the same task_kind fails with structured error.
14. **Bigint serialization:** `last_outbox_seq` is stored and read correctly as bigint (not lossy on values > 2^53).
15. **Authz post-filter:** synthetic deny rule edited → centralized post-filter excludes the affected rows even before the rebuild lands; stale-projection-cannot-grant-access verified.

Integration tests in `apps/api/test/integration/task-projection.spec.ts` and `apps/worker/test/integration/task-projection-consumer.spec.ts`.

- `ix_generation_fire_at ON (fire_at) WHERE status = 'pending'` — for retry sweep
- `ix_generation_run_kind ON (run_kind)` — operational filter

#### 13.4.2 Migrations

1. `1937200000000-add-recurrence-definitions.ts` — creates `automation.recurrence_definitions` + index.
2. `1937200000001-add-suppression-windows.ts` — creates `automation.suppression_windows` + indexes; includes the CHECK constraint on `end_at > start_at`.
3. `1937200000002-add-blackout-calendars.ts` — creates `automation.blackout_calendars` + GIN index on `dates`.
4. `1937200000003-add-shift-calendars.ts` — creates `automation.shift_calendars`.
5. `1937200000004-add-generation-runs.ts` — creates `automation.generation_runs` + ALL indexes including the UNIQUE `(idempotency_key)` (the load-bearing one).

All migrations stand alone; no inter-table dependencies that force ordering. Five small migrations rather than one mega-migration so each can be reverted independently if needed.

Register all five entities in `libs/instance-db/src/lib/entities/index.ts`.

#### 13.4.4 Services + RRULE library

**New library:** `libs/scheduling/` (Nx-buildable library, importable as `@hubblewave/scheduling`).

- Wraps `rrule.js` (battle-tested RFC 5545 implementation; MIT licensed).
- Exports `evaluateRRule(rrule: string, from: Date, until: Date, timezone: string): Date[]` returning all fire times in window.
- Exports `applyBlackoutMask(fireTimes: Date[], blackoutCalendarId: string): Promise<Date[]>` filtering out blackout dates.
- Exports `applyBusinessHours(fireTime: Date, businessHoursId?: string): Promise<Date>` shifting fire time to the next valid business-hours window if it falls outside.
- Exports `applyShiftMask(fireTime: Date, shiftCalendarId?: string): Promise<{within: boolean, nextValid: Date}>`.
- Self-test corpus of ≥ 20 RRULE strings with expected fire times across DST boundaries (high-stakes correctness; RRULE bugs are insidious).

**New worker service:** `apps/worker/src/scheduling/generation.service.ts` — the generic generation dispatcher.

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class GenerationDispatcher {
  constructor(
    private readonly dataSource: DataSource,
    private readonly scheduling: SchedulingService, // wraps libs/scheduling
    private readonly logger: Logger,
  ) {}

  /** Called periodically (e.g., every 5 minutes) per registered run_kind. */
  async dispatchPending(input: DispatchInput): Promise<DispatchResult> {
    // 1. Query all active schedules for input.runKind (e.g., pm_schedule rows with is_active = true)
    //    Each schedule has a recurrence_definition_id; resolve the RRULE.
    // 2. For each schedule, compute fire times in the [now, now + lookahead_minutes] window.
    // 3. For each fire time per subject record:
    //    a. Build idempotency_key
    //    b. Check active suppression_windows scoping to this subject/collection
    //    c. INSERT INTO generation_runs ... ON CONFLICT (idempotency_key) DO NOTHING
    //    d. If insert succeeded:
    //       - if suppressed → mark status=suppressed, suppressed_by=window_id, write audit
    //       - else → invoke the pack-registered handler (e.g., maintenance-core's create-WO action)
    //         on success: UPDATE generation_runs SET status='generated', generated_record_id=...
    //         on failure: status='failed', error_message=..., RuntimeAnomaly emitted
  }
}
```

The dispatcher is **generic** — the maintenance-core pack provides a handler for `run_kind = 'pm_generation'` that creates `maintenance_work_order` rows. The platform never references `pm_schedule` or `maintenance_work_order` by name.

#### 13.4.5 API endpoints

| Method | Path | Auth | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/automation/recurrences` | `@Roles('automation_admin')` | List all recurrence definitions |
| `POST` | `/automation/recurrences` | `@Roles('automation_admin')` | Create recurrence definition; validates RRULE via `libs/scheduling` parser |
| `PUT` | `/automation/recurrences/:id` | `@Roles('automation_admin')` | Update; deactivating an in-use recurrence refuses via W2.A reference-checker |
| `POST` | `/automation/suppression-windows` | `@Roles('automation_admin', 'maintenance_admin')` | Create suppression window |
| `POST` | `/automation/blackout-calendars` | `@Roles('automation_admin')` | — |
| `POST` | `/automation/shift-calendars` | `@Roles('automation_admin', 'hr_admin')` | — |
| `GET` | `/automation/generation-runs` | `@Roles('automation_admin', 'maintenance_admin')` | Filterable list of generation runs; shows status + suppressed_by + error_message |
| `POST` | `/automation/generation-runs/:id/retry` | `@Roles('automation_admin')` | Retry a failed generation (must be `status = failed`) |

#### 13.4.6 Validator extensions

Pack-publish validator:
1. **RRULE validity gate.** Every `recurrence_definition` declared in a pack manifest is parsed via `libs/scheduling.evaluateRRule()` against a 1-year horizon. Validator refuses publish if RRULE fails to parse or generates zero fire times.
2. **Suppression-window scope gate.** A `scope = 'record'` suppression window's `scope_record_id` must resolve to an existing record in `scope_collection_id`.
3. **`run_kind` namespace gate.** Pack-declared run_kinds must be prefixed with the pack id (e.g., `maintenance-core/pm_generation`) to prevent collision across packs.

#### 13.4.7 Service-boundary scanner rules

```typescript
'automation.recurrence_definitions': { writers: ['apps/api/src/app/automation/scheduling/**'], readers: ['apps/worker/src/scheduling/**'] },
'automation.suppression_windows': { writers: ['apps/api/src/app/automation/scheduling/**'], readers: ['apps/worker/src/scheduling/**'] },
'automation.blackout_calendars': { writers: ['apps/api/src/app/automation/scheduling/**'], readers: ['apps/worker/src/scheduling/**', 'apps/worker/src/maintenance/**'] },
'automation.shift_calendars': { writers: ['apps/api/src/app/automation/scheduling/**'], readers: ['apps/worker/src/maintenance/**', 'apps/api/src/app/views/**'] },
'automation.generation_runs': { writers: ['apps/worker/src/scheduling/**'], readers: ['apps/api/src/app/automation/scheduling/**'] },
```

#### 13.4.8 Tests (self-test ≥ 15 assertions)

1. RRULE library: 20-entry corpus of RFC 5545 strings → expected fire times match (DST boundaries, leap years, end-of-month edge cases).
2. Generation idempotency: two concurrent worker pods dispatch the same schedule for the same subject + fire_at → only one `generation_runs` row created; the other INSERT fails on UNIQUE.
3. Suppression: a fire time inside an active suppression window → row gets `status = 'suppressed'`, `suppressed_by = window_id`, audit row written.
4. Blackout calendar mask: RRULE that would fire on a holiday → masked out → no `generation_runs` insert.
5. Business-hours mask: fire time outside business hours → shifted to next valid window per `BusinessHours.id` policy.
6. Shift calendar mask: a `pm_generation` for a technician group whose shift calendar is "M-F 8am-5pm" + fire time at Saturday 2am → next valid Monday morning slot.
7. Pack-validator RRULE failure: malformed RRULE → publish refused with structured error.
8. Pack-validator run_kind namespace: an un-namespaced `run_kind` fails publish.
9. Failed generation: handler throws → `status = 'failed'`, `error_message` populated, `RuntimeAnomaly` row inserted.
10. Retry endpoint: retry of a failed generation → handler re-invoked; on success, `status = 'generated'`.
11. Scope-record suppression validator: a window with `scope_record_id` referencing a deleted record fails publish.
12. Recurrence reference-check (W2.A): deleting a `recurrence_definition` referenced by an active `pm_schedule` refuses with structured "in-use" error.
13. DST forward-shift correctness: an RRULE firing at 2:30am on a DST-spring-forward day → resolved to 3:30am same day (not skipped).
14. DST backward-shift correctness: an RRULE firing at 1:30am on a DST-fall-back day → fires once (not twice).
15. Cross-month boundary: an RRULE with `FREQ=MONTHLY;BYMONTHDAY=31` → February → no fire (not Feb 28/29 fallback unless explicitly configured).

Integration tests in `apps/worker/test/integration/generation-dispatcher.spec.ts` exercise the full path against a Postgres testcontainer.

### 13.5 Worked example: §3.4 List-Scale Primitives (full artifact-level spec)

#### 13.5.1 Tables

**`data.list_snapshots`** — materialized list-view snapshots for huge canned views (e.g., "All Open WOs in Building 5") that get re-served from snapshot for short TTLs.

| Column | Type | Default | Nullable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | `uuid` | `gen_random_uuid()` | NOT NULL | PK |
| `view_id` | `uuid` | — | NOT NULL | FK → `metadata.view_definitions(id)` |
| `scope_principal` | `varchar(255)` | — | NOT NULL | Hash of `(user_id, role_set, group_set)` — snapshots are principal-scoped so masking is precomputed for the scoping principal |
| `query_hash` | `bytea(32)` | — | NOT NULL | SHA-256 of canonical query (view_id + filters + sort) — enables cache hits for identical queries |
| `total_rows` | `int` | — | NOT NULL | Pre-computed row count (avoids re-counting on each pagination request) |
| `generated_at` | `timestamptz` | `now()` | NOT NULL | When snapshot was built |
| `ttl_at` | `timestamptz` | — | NOT NULL | Snapshot becomes invalid after `ttl_at`; default `generated_at + 5 min` per view-config override |
| `builder_event_id` | `uuid` | — | NULL | Event that triggered build (for traceability) |

**Indexes:**
- PK on `(id)`
- `ux_list_snapshot_query` UNIQUE ON `(view_id, scope_principal, query_hash)` WHERE `ttl_at > now()` — at most one active snapshot per (view, principal, query) tuple
- `ix_list_snapshot_ttl` ON `(ttl_at)` WHERE `ttl_at < now()` — for GC sweep

**`data.list_snapshot_rows`** — actual row payloads, partitioned by `snapshot_id`.

| Column | Type | Default | Nullable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `snapshot_id` | `uuid` | — | NOT NULL | LIST partition key (so all rows for one snapshot live in one partition; dropping a snapshot = drop partition) |
| `position` | `int` | — | NOT NULL | 0-indexed position within snapshot for stable pagination |
| `source_record_id` | `uuid` | — | NOT NULL | Reference back to source row |
| `payload_jsonb` | `jsonb` | — | NOT NULL | Denormalized projection-safe + masked-per-principal payload |

**Partitioning:** `PARTITION BY LIST (snapshot_id)`. Each new snapshot gets a new sub-partition; `ttl_at` expiry → drop the partition (instant, no row-by-row delete).

**Indexes** (per sub-partition):
- PK on `(snapshot_id, position)`

#### 13.5.2 Active/archive partitioning policy (codified per `taskable_capability`)

This is NOT a new table — it's a per-capability configuration in `metadata.taskable_capabilities`:

Adds a new column to `metadata.taskable_capabilities`:
- `archive_age_months` `int` `NOT NULL` `DEFAULT 24` — closed records older than this age move from active to archive partition tree. Editable per pack.

The worker job `apps/worker/src/archive/partition-steward.job.ts` (already declared §9) reads each capability's `archive_age_months` and detaches `*_old_*` partitions from the active parent, attaches them to the archive parent. **Archive partitions are NEVER deleted** — only detached and re-attached to the archive tree. Compliance §10 (7-year retention) requires this.

#### 13.5.3 Mobile list payload + Archive query facade

**Mobile list payload service:** `apps/api/src/app/mobile/mobile-list-payload.service.ts` (NEW)

Endpoint: `GET /mobile/tasks/sync?since=<timestamp>&kind=<task_kind>&assigned_to=<user_id>`. Returns a hyper-dense JSON for WatermelonDB: one row per task with denormalized `{wo, asset, location, due_at, parts_ready, last_checklist_state}` chips pulled from `task_projection.attrs_jsonb` (per §3.2 projection_safe gate). Selective sync per `mobile_sync_policies` (§3.7).

**Archive query facade:** `apps/api/src/app/archive/archive-query-facade.service.ts` (NEW)

Endpoint: `GET /archive/tasks?from=<iso>&to=<iso>&filters=...`. Opens cold partitions explicitly via Postgres `ALTER TABLE ... ATTACH PARTITION` (or equivalent partition-aware query). Slow (minutes); audited via `audit_logs` with `purpose = regulator_archive_query`; Compliance Officer + Auditor Kiosk session principals authorized.

#### 13.5.4 PR breakdown for §3.4

| PR | Goal | Files | Acceptance |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 1 | Tables + migrations | 2 migration files (`list_snapshots`, `list_snapshot_rows` partitioned root) + 1 alter on `taskable_capabilities` (add `archive_age_months`) | Migrations + scanner pass |
| 2 | Snapshot builder worker | `apps/worker/src/projections/list-snapshot-builder.service.ts` | Self-test: build snapshot from a 100k-row view; subsequent identical query returns from snapshot in <50ms |
| 3 | Mobile list payload endpoint | `apps/api/src/app/mobile/mobile-list-payload.service.ts` + controller | Self-test: `GET /mobile/tasks/sync` returns <1MB for one technician's day |
| 4 | Archive query facade + partition steward extensions | `apps/api/src/app/archive/`; `apps/worker/src/archive/partition-steward.job.ts` extensions | Self-test: detach a closed-WO partition older than 24 months → archive query still returns its rows; active list view does not |

**Total: 4 PRs for §3.4. Estimated effort: ~4 working days.**

### 13.6 Worked example: §3.5 Time-Series Observations (full artifact-level spec — second-largest substrate section)

#### 13.6.1 Tables

All tables live in `schema: 'observations'` (NEW dedicated schema). Subject binding is generic — `subject_collection_id` + `subject_record_id` + `stream_kind` — no asset/meter coupling at the platform layer.

**`observations.observation_streams`** — one row per addressable time-series stream.

| Column | Type | Default | Nullable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | `uuid` | `gen_random_uuid()` | NOT NULL | PK |
| `code` | `varchar(120)` | — | NOT NULL | UNIQUE per instance |
| `subject_collection_id` | `uuid` | — | NOT NULL | FK → `metadata.collection_definitions(id)`. Generic: maintenance pack binds asset; the platform doesn't know what an asset is |
| `subject_record_id` | `uuid` | — | NOT NULL | The specific subject (e.g., a specific asset record) |
| `stream_kind` | `varchar(64)` | — | NOT NULL | Pack-defined vocabulary; e.g., `meter`, `setpoint`, `sensor`, `gps_lat`, `engine_rpm` |
| `unit_code` | `varchar(32)` | — | NOT NULL | FK → `observation_units(code)` |
| `data_type` | `varchar(32)` | — | NOT NULL | `numeric` / `boolean` / `enum` |
| `source_adapter` | `varchar(64)` | — | NOT NULL | `bacnet` / `modbus` / `hl7` / `manual` / `mqtt` / `webhook` / `obd2-telematics-feed` / `wifi-beacon-occupancy` |
| `expected_interval_seconds` | `int` | — | NULL | Expected cadence; gap-detection alarms reference this |
| `quality_floor` | `varchar(20)` | `'good'` | NOT NULL | Minimum acceptable quality tag; readings below this are dropped |
| `retention_days` | `int` | `365` | NOT NULL | Per-stream retention; partition-steward respects |
| `rollup_policy_id` | `uuid` | — | NULL | FK → `observation_rollup_policies(id)`; controls which rollup tables are maintained |
| `is_active` | `boolean` | `true` | NOT NULL | — |
| `created_at` | `timestamptz` | `now()` | NOT NULL | — |
| `updated_at` | `timestamptz` | `now()` | NOT NULL | Trigger-maintained |

Indexes: PK; UNIQUE `(code)`; `ix_streams_subject ON (subject_collection_id, subject_record_id)`; `ix_streams_active ON (is_active) WHERE is_active = true`; `ix_streams_source_adapter ON (source_adapter)`.

**`observations.observations`** — the hot append-only readings table. RANGE-partitioned monthly via pg_partman.

| Column | Type | Default | Nullable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | `bigserial` | — | NOT NULL | Part of PK with `(stream_id, recorded_at)`; bigserial because volumes are huge |
| `stream_id` | `uuid` | — | NOT NULL | FK → `observation_streams(id)` |
| `recorded_at` | `timestamptz` | — | NOT NULL | RANGE partition key |
| `value_numeric` | `double precision` | — | NULL | Used when stream.data_type = 'numeric' |
| `value_text` | `text` | — | NULL | Used for 'enum' or free-form |
| `value_bool` | `boolean` | — | NULL | Used for 'boolean' |
| `quality` | `varchar(20)` | `'good'` | NOT NULL | Tag — sensor health |
| `source_adapter` | `varchar(64)` | — | NOT NULL | Denormalized for audit / forensic |
| `ingested_at` | `timestamptz` | `now()` | NOT NULL | When the worker landed the row (vs `recorded_at` which is the sensor's clock) |

**Partitioning:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE observations.observations (...) PARTITION BY RANGE (recorded_at);
SELECT partman.create_parent(
  'observations.observations',
  'recorded_at', 'native', 'monthly',
  p_premake := 3
);
```

**Indexes** (per monthly partition):
- PK on `(stream_id, recorded_at, id)` — composite required by RANGE partitioning
- BRIN on `(recorded_at)` — block-range index efficient for monotonically-increasing timestamps
- `ix_observations_stream_recorded` on `(stream_id, recorded_at DESC)` — for "latest N readings on stream X" queries

**`observations.observation_units`** — unit dictionary (seeded).

| Column | Type | Default | Nullable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `code` | `varchar(32)` | — | NOT NULL | PK — `°C`, `°F`, `kPa`, `psi`, `runtime_hours`, `mph`, `kg`, `lux`, etc. |
| `name` | `varchar(120)` | — | NOT NULL | — |
| `dimension` | `varchar(64)` | — | NOT NULL | `temperature` / `pressure` / `length` / `time` / `mass` / `illuminance` |
| `si_conversion_factor` | `double precision` | `1.0` | NOT NULL | Multiplier to convert to SI base unit |
| `si_conversion_offset` | `double precision` | `0.0` | NOT NULL | Offset (needed for temperature) |

Indexes: PK on `(code)`.

**`observations.observation_rollup_policies`** — declares which rollup tables to populate per stream.

| Column | Type | Default | Nullable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | `uuid` | `gen_random_uuid()` | NOT NULL | PK |
| `code` | `varchar(120)` | — | NOT NULL | UNIQUE — e.g., `default_thermometer`, `vibration_high_cadence` |
| `hourly_enabled` | `boolean` | `true` | NOT NULL | — |
| `daily_enabled` | `boolean` | `true` | NOT NULL | — |
| `weekly_enabled` | `boolean` | `true` | NOT NULL | — |
| `aggregations` | `varchar(64)[]` | `'{min,max,avg,p50,p95}'` | NOT NULL | Which aggregations to compute |

**`observations.observation_rollups_hourly` / `_daily` / `_weekly`** — explicit rollup tables (NOT pg_ivm — see §3.5 decision and canon §31).

Same column set per granularity:
| Column | Type | Default | Nullable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `stream_id` | `uuid` | — | NOT NULL | PK with bucket_start |
| `bucket_start` | `timestamptz` | — | NOT NULL | Bucket start time (hour / day / week boundary) |
| `min_value` | `double precision` | — | NULL | — |
| `max_value` | `double precision` | — | NULL | — |
| `avg_value` | `double precision` | — | NULL | — |
| `p50_value` | `double precision` | — | NULL | Approximated via Postgres `percentile_disc` |
| `p95_value` | `double precision` | — | NULL | — |
| `sample_count` | `int` | — | NOT NULL | Number of source observations in bucket |
| `last_refreshed_at` | `timestamptz` | `now()` | NOT NULL | When the rollup row was last upserted |

Partition by RANGE on `bucket_start` (yearly for hourly, multi-year for daily/weekly).

Indexes: PK `(stream_id, bucket_start)`; `ix_rollup_bucket_desc ON (bucket_start DESC)` for "show me last N buckets".

**`observations.observation_alerts`** — optional threshold-based alerts (rules emit reactive WO via automation).

| Column | Type | Default | Nullable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | `uuid` | `gen_random_uuid()` | NOT NULL | PK |

#### 13.6.2 Migrations

1. `1937300000000-add-observations-schema.ts` — creates `observations` schema.
2. `1937300000001-add-observation-units.ts` — creates `observation_units` + seeds the standard dictionary (~50 entries: °C, °F, kPa, psi, runtime_hours, mph, kg, lux, etc.).
3. `1937300000002-add-observation-streams.ts` — creates `observation_streams`.
4. `1937300000003-add-observation-rollup-policies.ts` — creates `observation_rollup_policies` + seeds defaults.
5. `1937300000004-add-observations-partitioned.ts` — creates partitioned `observations` parent + pg_partman setup.
6. `1937300000005-add-observation-rollups.ts` — creates 3 rollup tables + per-table partitioning.
7. `1937300000006-add-observation-alerts.ts` — creates `observation_alerts`.

Each migration discrete + reversible. Migration 5 is special — must run `partman.create_parent` after table creation.

#### 13.6.3 TypeORM entities

**New file:** `libs/instance-db/src/lib/entities/observations.entity.ts` — 7 entities (`ObservationStream`, `Observation`, `ObservationUnit`, `ObservationRollupPolicy`, `ObservationRollupHourly`, `ObservationRollupDaily`, `ObservationRollupWeekly`, `ObservationAlert`). Standard TypeORM decoration; `ObservationUnit` uses `code` as PK.

#### 13.6.4 Services

**Worker ingest pipeline:** `apps/worker/src/observations/ingest.service.ts` (NEW)

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class ObservationIngestService {
  /** Per-adapter buffer for 5s coalescing; on flush, batched COPY-style insert. */
  async ingest(events: IngestEvent[]): Promise<void> {
    // Group by stream_id; for each stream, look up retention_days + quality_floor;
    // drop events below quality_floor; convert source-adapter values via unit dictionary;
    // INSERT INTO observations.observations(...) VALUES ... (batched 1000+/insert).
    // Idempotency via (stream_id, recorded_at, source_adapter_event_id) uniqueness if event_id present.
  }
}
```

**Adapter contracts:** `apps/worker/src/observations/adapters/{bacnet,modbus,mqtt,hl7,obd2,wifi-beacon,manual,webhook}.adapter.ts` — each implements `IngestionAdapter` interface from §3.13 connector runtime.

**Rollup service:** `apps/worker/src/observations/rollup.service.ts` (referenced in §9 critical files)

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class ObservationRollupService {
  /** Scheduled per granularity: hourly every 5 min, daily every hour, weekly every day. */
  async refreshHourly(): Promise<void> {
    // INSERT INTO observation_rollups_hourly (stream_id, bucket_start, min, max, avg, p50, p95, sample_count)
    // SELECT stream_id, date_trunc('hour', recorded_at), min(...), max(...), avg(...), percentile_disc(0.5), percentile_disc(0.95), count(*)
    // FROM observations.observations
    // WHERE recorded_at >= last_refreshed_at AND recorded_at < now() - INTERVAL '1 hour'  -- avoid open bucket
    // GROUP BY stream_id, date_trunc('hour', recorded_at)
    // ON CONFLICT (stream_id, bucket_start) DO UPDATE SET ...;
    // -- aggregation runs in Postgres; the worker only issues the statement + observes lag
  }
  // similar for refreshDaily / refreshWeekly
}
```

Rollup-refresh lag visible in `task_projection_lag`-equivalent operational table (or extend that one).

**API service:** `apps/api/src/app/observations/observations.service.ts` — read APIs for raw + rollup data.

#### 13.6.5 API endpoints

| Method | Path | Auth | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/observations/streams` | `@Roles` | List streams (filterable by subject_collection_id + subject_record_id) |
| `POST` | `/observations/streams` | `@Roles('observations_admin')` | Create stream (rare — usually pack-installed) |
| `GET` | `/observations/streams/:id/readings?from=&to=&limit=` | `@Roles` per subject collection | Raw readings paginated |
| `GET` | `/observations/streams/:id/rollups/:granularity?from=&to=` | `@Roles` per subject | Rollup data for charts (hourly / daily / weekly) |
| `POST` | `/observations/ingest` | `@AllowServiceToken @RequireServiceScope('observations:ingest')` | Webhook ingest endpoint for non-adapter sources |

#### 13.6.6 Validator extensions

1. **Stream unit consistency**: when a pack declares an `observation_streams` row, the `unit_code` must exist in `observation_units` AND the `data_type` (numeric/bool/enum) must be compatible with the unit's `dimension`.
2. **Rollup policy resolution**: if `rollup_policy_id` is set, it must reference an existing policy and the policy's `aggregations` array must be non-empty.
3. **Adapter declaration**: `source_adapter` must reference a registered `integration_adapter_registry` row (§3.13).

#### 13.6.7 Service-boundary scanner rules

```typescript
'observations.observation_streams': { writers: ['apps/api/src/app/observations/**', 'apps/worker/src/observations/adapters/**'], readers: ['apps/api/src/app/observations/**', 'apps/api/src/app/views/**', 'apps/api/src/app/ai/**'] },
'observations.observations': { writers: ['apps/worker/src/observations/ingest.service.ts', 'apps/worker/src/observations/adapters/**'], readers: ['apps/api/src/app/observations/**'] },
'observations.observation_units': { writers: ['apps/api/src/app/observations/admin/**'], readers: ['apps/api/src/app/observations/**', 'apps/worker/src/observations/**'] },
'observations.observation_rollups_*': { writers: ['apps/worker/src/observations/rollup.service.ts'], readers: ['apps/api/src/app/observations/**', 'apps/api/src/app/views/**'] },
'observations.observation_alerts': { writers: ['apps/api/src/app/observations/admin/**'], readers: ['apps/worker/src/observations/alert-evaluator.service.ts'] },
```

#### 13.6.8 Tests (self-test ≥ 15 assertions)

1. Stream creation: minimal valid stream → succeeds; missing unit → fails validator.
2. Ingest 100k readings → all land in correct monthly partition.
3. pg_partman creates next month's partition automatically (advance the clock to month-end, verify partition exists).
4. Quality floor: readings below `quality_floor` dropped at ingest; not stored.
5. Unit conversion at ingest: a Fahrenheit BACnet reading → stored as-is + tagged with unit; rollup queries can convert via `observation_units.si_conversion_factor`.
6. Hourly rollup refresh: 60 readings within an hour → one rollup row with correct min/max/avg/p50/p95.
7. Rollup refresh doesn't re-process closed buckets: idempotent for old hours; only the newest hour gets recomputed if it's been refreshed before.
8. Daily rollup builds from hourly rollups (cascading aggregation) where appropriate.
9. Alert: a threshold-above alert + a reading exceeding threshold → automation rule fires + cooldown_seconds honored on subsequent readings within window.
10. Gap detection: stream's `expected_interval_seconds = 60` + no readings for 5 min → gap_detected alert fires once.
11. Retention: stream's `retention_days = 30` + monthly partition older than 30 days → partition-steward marks for archive (but does NOT delete; compliance §10).
12. Worker idempotency: duplicate ingest event_id (where the source adapter provides one) → second ingest no-ops via `processed_events`.
13. Z-score outlier alert: a reading 4σ from the rolling-24h mean → outlier alert fires.
14. Adapter health: BACnet adapter loses connection → `observation_streams.is_active` for streams from that adapter NOT auto-deactivated (alert only); manual or policy decision.
15. Read API authz: §28 evaluator filters readings by subject record visibility (a tech who can't see the asset can't see its readings).

### 13.7 Worked example: §3.6 Regulated-Action Primitives (full artifact-level spec — e-signature + Merkle batch + Part 11 envelope)

#### 13.7.1 Tables

All tables live in `schema: 'compliance'` (NEW dedicated schema). Five tables: `reason_codes`, `electronic_signatures`, `signature_chains`, `evidence_artifacts`, `attestation_jobs`. The platform never deletes from `signature_chains`, `electronic_signatures`, or `evidence_artifacts` — 7-year retention via active/archive partitioning per canon §34.

**`compliance.reason_codes`** — seeded vocabulary; one row per pack-scoped reason.

| Column | Type | Default | Nullable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | `uuid` | `gen_random_uuid()` | NOT NULL | PK |

#### 13.7.2 Partitioning strategy

- `compliance.signature_chains` — RANGE partition by `created_at`, yearly, native partitioning. `signature_chains_active_YYYY` is the current write target; once `now() - INTERVAL '13 months'`, partition flips to `signature_chains_archive_YYYY` (READ ONLY via revocation of INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE from runtime roles). Never DROP.
- `compliance.electronic_signatures` — RANGE partition by `signed_at_utc`, yearly, same policy.
- `compliance.evidence_artifacts` — RANGE partition by `captured_at`, yearly, same policy. Evidence whose `retention_until > partition_max_date` AND `legal_hold = false` does NOT prevent partition flip-to-archive (archive is read-only, NOT delete). Object Lock on S3 enforces the binding storage-side guarantee.
- `compliance.reason_codes` — single table; small cardinality.
- `compliance.attestation_jobs` — single table; rows pruned by `expires_at + 30 days` retention sweep (the job rows themselves expire; bundles they generated have their own retention via `evidence_artifacts` linkage).

pg_partman is NOT used here — yearly partitions are infrequent enough that explicit per-year migration files are tractable and auditable (pg_partman config drift is a known auditor objection in regulated industries).

The `compliance` area file is added to `libs/instance-db/src/lib/entities/index.ts` per the W6.A area-split barrel pattern (Plan Fix 24 PR-A).

#### 13.7.5 Services

`apps/api/src/app/compliance/` (new module).

**`SignatureService`** — `apps/api/src/app/compliance/signature/signature.service.ts`:

```typescript
sign(input: SignRequest, requestContext: UserRequestContext): Promise<SignatureResult>;
listForRecord(collectionId: string, recordId: string, ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<ElectronicSignature[]>;
verifyChainExtension(signatureId: string, ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<ChainVerificationResult>;
```

Contract for `sign(...)`:
1. Resolve authority via `AuthorizationService.canPerformAction(actionCode, collectionId, recordId, ctx)` — must return `allow`. 403 with canon §28 minimal shape on deny; `AccessAuditPort.logAccessDenied` row written.
2. Resolve re-auth requirement via `signatureMeaningPolicy(signatureMeaning)` (founder-locked matrix, §13.7.5.1).
3. Validate presented re-auth proof matches requirement:
   - `session`: ensure session idle < 5 minutes (compare `session.last_activity_at` to `now()`).
   - `totp`: validate the presented code via `TotpService.verify(userId, code)` — code from the last 30s window.
   - `webauthn`: validate the presented assertion via `WebAuthnService.verifyAssertion(userId, assertion)` — assertion timestamp within 60s.
4. Validate `reason_code_id` is active AND `signatureMeaning ∈ reasonCode.applicableSignatureMeanings`. 400 with structured error on violation.
5. Compute canonical payload bytes from the action payload (record snapshot at sign-time) and SHA-256 it → `payload_hash`.
6. Inside `withAudit(dataSource, async () => { ... })`:
   - Insert `electronic_signatures` row (pre-generate `chainEntryId` UUID).
   - Insert `signature_chains` row with `entry_kind = 'signature'`, `signature_id = electronic_signature.id`. `SignatureChainSubscriber` populates `previous_hash` + `hash` under advisory lock.
   - Audit log entry written by `withAudit`.
7. Return `{ signatureId, chainEntryId, hash, signedAt, auditLogId }`.

**`MerkleBatchService`** — `apps/api/src/app/compliance/signature/merkle-batch.service.ts`:

```typescript
batchSign(input: BatchSignRequest, requestContext: UserRequestContext): Promise<BatchSignResult>;
```

Contract for `batchSign(...)`:
1. Validate `input.actions.length ≤ 256` — 400 with structured error `MERKLE_BATCH_CAP_EXCEEDED` if violated. The 256-leaf cap is founder-locked (2026-05-17) to bound tree depth (log2 = 8) and keep auditor verification predictable.
2. Validate every action's `signatureMeaning` resolves to the SAME re-auth tier (e.g., all `closure` or all `review`); mixed-tier batches rejected with `MERKLE_BATCH_MIXED_MEANING`. Re-auth happens ONCE for the batch; meaning establishes the re-auth bar.
3. Resolve authority + reason-code validation per-action (§13.7.5 step 1+4 applied N times). Any per-action failure rejects the whole batch — partial commits forbidden.
4. Build canonical leaf bytes per action: concatenation `signer_user_id || signer_display_name_at_sign_time || signer_login_at_sign_time || signed_at_utc || action_code || target_collection_id || target_record_id || reason_code_id || signature_meaning || payload_hash`. All UTF-8 NFC-normalized; separators are the 0x1F (US) ASCII byte; `signed_at_utc` serialized as RFC 3339 with `Z` suffix.
5. SHA-256 over each leaf → `leaf_hash`.
6. Build Merkle tree (binary, balanced; pad odd levels by duplicating the last node). `root_hash` = root of tree.
7. Inside `withAudit(...)`:
   - For each action: insert `electronic_signatures` row carrying `merkle_root_chain_entry_id` pointing to the merkle_root row (created next).
   - Emit ONE `signature_chains` row with `entry_kind = 'merkle_root'` and `payload.leaves[]` carrying per-leaf hashes. ALL N actions' `chain_entry_id` AND `merkle_root_chain_entry_id` point to this single merkle_root row — the merkle_root IS the chain extension for the batch. Root hash binds every leaf cryptographically; per-leaf chain rows are intentionally elided.
   - The merkle_root insert is preceded by the comment marker `// @AuditMerkleBatchInsert` so `audit-bypass-check.ts` recognizes the batched-leaves payload as allowed (§13.7.8).
   - Audit log entry per the entire batch (one row).
8. Return `{ signatures: [{id, leafHashHex}], rootChainEntryId, rootHashHex, signedAt, auditLogId }`.

**`ReasonCodeService`** — standard CRUD with validator hooks; pack installer calls `seedPackReasonCodes(packId, definitions)` during pack install.

**`EvidenceArtifactService`** — `apps/api/src/app/compliance/evidence/evidence-artifact.service.ts`:

```typescript
attach(input: AttachEvidenceRequest, ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<EvidenceArtifact>;
fetchSignedDownloadUrl(artifactId: string, ttlSeconds: number, ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<string>;
applyLegalHold(artifactId: string, reasonText: string, ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<void>;
releaseLegalHold(artifactId: string, reasonText: string, ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<void>;
```

`attach(...)` flow: multipart upload → S3 `PutObject` with `ObjectLockMode='COMPLIANCE'`, `ObjectLockRetainUntilDate=retention_until`, `ChecksumSHA256` set; verify returned `VersionId`; compute server-side SHA-256 of the response body and compare to the request SHA-256 (defense-in-depth against in-flight tamper); insert `evidence_artifacts` row via `withAudit(...)`.

`applyLegalHold(...)` / `releaseLegalHold(...)` use S3 `PutObjectLegalHold` in addition to the `legal_hold` column flip; the operation order — S3 first, then DB row commit — means S3 leads truth on failure (DB rollback after S3 success is a known divergence; reconciliation sweep runs nightly). `releaseLegalHold` writes a high-severity audit row via `AccessAuditPort.logSecurityEvent({ severity: 'high', kind: 'legal_hold_released', ... })`.

**`Part11AttestationService`** — `apps/api/src/app/compliance/attestation/attestation.service.ts` (API side; export work runs in `apps/worker`):

```typescript
enqueueExport(input: AttestationExportRequest, ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<{ jobId: string }>;
status(jobId: string, ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<AttestationJobStatus>;
```

Worker side (`apps/worker/src/compliance/attestation-export.processor.ts`): on BullMQ job pickup, walks the target's signature chain + evidence artifacts; renders a PDF via pdfkit (auditor-readable layout); writes a JSON canonical export including chain proof (every `signature_chains.hash` replayable from `payload + previous_hash`); writes an S3 manifest enumerating evidence artifact storage URIs with 7-day signed URLs. All three artifacts written to S3 with `COMPLIANCE` retention. Job row transitions `queued → running → completed`. The bundle itself is registered as a recursive `evidence_artifact` so its own integrity is auditable.

##### 13.7.5.1 Signature meaning re-auth policy (founder-locked 2026-05-17)

| `signature_meaning` | Required re-auth method | Freshness window |
|---|---|---|
| `review` | `session` (idle < 5 min) | session token still valid |
| `approval` | `totp` OR `webauthn` | code/assertion < 60s old |
| `responsibility` | `webauthn` | assertion < 60s old |
| `verification` | `webauthn` | assertion < 60s old |
| `closure` | `webauthn` | assertion < 60s old |

Hard-coded in `SignatureService.signatureMeaningPolicy` constant; NOT runtime-configurable per pack. Founder-locked because the matrix maps to FDA inspection expectations — a customer-tunable matrix is a compliance-defense liability. Reflected in §13.7.9 test #2.

#### 13.7.6 API endpoints

All endpoints under `apps/api/src/app/compliance/`. Every handler carries exactly one primary boundary decorator per W2 Stream 3 (`@RequirePermission` OR `@RequireCollectionAccess` OR `@AuthenticatedOnly`). All permission codes added to `libs/permission-registry`.

| Method | Path | Boundary | Body / params |
|---|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/api/compliance/signatures` | `@RequirePermission('compliance:signature:sign')` | `{ collectionId, recordId, actionCode, signatureMeaning, reasonCodeId, reauthMethod, reauthProof, payloadSnapshot }` |
| `POST` | `/api/compliance/signatures/batch` | `@RequirePermission('compliance:signature:sign')` | `{ actions: [...same as single...] }` (length ≤ 256) |
| `GET` | `/api/compliance/signatures/:id` | `@RequirePermission('compliance:signature:read')` | — |
| `GET` | `/api/compliance/records/:collectionId/:recordId/signatures` | `@RequireCollectionAccess('read')` | — |
| `POST` | `/api/compliance/signatures/:id/verify` | `@RequirePermission('compliance:signature:read')` | — returns chain replay result |
| `GET` | `/api/compliance/reason-codes` | `@AuthenticatedOnly()` | query: `meaning`, `packId`, `category` |
| `POST` | `/api/compliance/reason-codes` | `@RequirePermission('compliance:reason_code:manage')` | admin / pack-installer path |
| `POST` | `/api/compliance/evidence` | `@RequirePermission('compliance:evidence:attach')` | multipart with `record`, `metadata` JSON part |
| `GET` | `/api/compliance/evidence/:id` | `@RequireCollectionAccess('read')` (resolved via artifact's record) | — returns metadata + 60s signed URL |
| `POST` | `/api/compliance/evidence/:id/legal-hold` | `@RequirePermission('compliance:legal_hold:apply')` | `{ reasonText }` |
| `DELETE` | `/api/compliance/evidence/:id/legal-hold` | `@RequirePermission('compliance:legal_hold:release')` | `{ reasonText }` |
| `POST` | `/api/compliance/attestations` | `@RequirePermission('compliance:attestation:export')` | `{ targetKind, targetCollectionId?, targetRecordId?, targetFilter? }` returns 202 `{ jobId }` |
| `GET` | `/api/compliance/attestations/:id` | `@RequirePermission('compliance:attestation:export')` | — |

Permission codes added to `PERMISSION_REGISTRY` (W2 Stream 2 PR3 vocabulary):
- `compliance:signature:sign`, `compliance:signature:read`
- `compliance:reason_code:manage`
- `compliance:evidence:attach`
- `compliance:legal_hold:apply` (dangerous: false)
- `compliance:legal_hold:release` (dangerous: true)
- `compliance:attestation:export`

#### 13.7.7 Validator extensions

Pack validator (`libs/pack-validator`) gains 5 publish gates:

1. **G7.1** — Any collection with `taskable.requires_signature = true` MUST have at least one reason_code seeded by the pack whose `applicable_signature_meanings` includes the collection's declared `closure_signature_meaning`. Error: `MISSING_REASON_CODE_FOR_CLOSURE_SIGNATURE`.
2. **G7.2** — Every pack-owned `reason_codes.code` MUST match regex `^${packId}__[a-z0-9_]+$`. Error: `REASON_CODE_NAMESPACE_VIOLATION`.
3. **G7.3** — Every `applicable_signature_meanings[]` value MUST be in the canonical enum `{review, approval, responsibility, verification, closure}`. Error: `INVALID_SIGNATURE_MEANING`.
4. **G7.4** — Pack workflows referencing a `reason_code_id` MUST reference one seeded by THAT pack OR by `platform__*`. Cross-pack reason-code references rejected. Error: `CROSS_PACK_REASON_CODE_REFERENCE`.
5. **G7.5** — `evidence_artifacts.retention_class` referenced by pack collections MUST be in the canonical enum. Error: `INVALID_RETENTION_CLASS`.

#### 13.7.8 Service-boundary scanner rules

`tools/service-boundary-check.ts` `KNOWN_WRITES` table gains:

| Entity | Allowed writers |
|---|---|
| `ElectronicSignature` | `SignatureService.sign`, `MerkleBatchService.batchSign` |
| `SignatureChainEntry` | `SignatureService.sign`, `MerkleBatchService.batchSign` |
| `ReasonCode` | `ReasonCodeService.*`, `PackInstaller.seedPackReasonCodes` |
| `EvidenceArtifact` | `EvidenceArtifactService.*`, `RetentionSweepService.markExpired` |
| `AttestationJob` | `Part11AttestationService.enqueueExport`, `AttestationExportProcessor.process` |

`tools/audit-bypass-check.ts` `AUDIT_LOG_BULK_INSERT_ALLOWLIST` gains ONE entry:

```typescript
{
  file: 'apps/api/src/app/compliance/signature/merkle-batch.service.ts',
  pattern: '@AuditMerkleBatchInsert',
  rationale: 'Merkle batch root emits ONE signature_chains row with entry_kind=merkle_root; leaf rows go in electronic_signatures (single-row inserts via withAudit, individually linearized). The merkle_root row IS the chain extension for the batch; root hash binds every leaf. Per canon §3.6 Merkle-batch ruling and Plan Fix 41 linearization carve-out.',
  reference: 'docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-16-clinical-facilities-asset-maintenance-design.md §13.7'
}
```

Without the `@AuditMerkleBatchInsert` marker, any batched insert on `signature_chains` or `electronic_signatures` continues to fail the scanner.

`tools/permission-registry-sync-check.ts` enforces the 7 new permission codes each have ≥ 1 call site.

#### 13.7.9 Tests (self-test ≥ 15 assertions)

Integration tests at `apps/api/test/integration/compliance-*.spec.ts`:

1. **`compliance-signature-happy-path.spec.ts`** — single signature: writes one `electronic_signatures` row + one `signature_chains` row with `entry_kind='signature'`; chain `previous_hash` extends from prior row's `hash`; `audit_log_id` resolves to a row in `identity.audit_logs`.
2. **`compliance-signature-reauth-matrix.spec.ts`** — 10 test cases across 5 meanings × 3 methods × pass/fail. Confirms `review` accepts session and rejects expired session; `approval` accepts totp + webauthn and rejects session; `responsibility/verification/closure` accept only webauthn.
3. **`compliance-signature-leaf-replay.spec.ts`** — after sign, recompute leaf canonical bytes from row columns alone → SHA-256 → matches `signature_chains.hash` after stripping the `previous_hash` prefix.
4. **`compliance-merkle-batch-100.spec.ts`** — 100-leaf batch: writes 100 `electronic_signatures` rows + 1 `signature_chains` row (`entry_kind=merkle_root`); root hash equals tree built from leaves; `merkle_leaf_count=100`.
5. **`compliance-merkle-batch-cap-exceeded.spec.ts`** — 257-action batch rejected with structured error `MERKLE_BATCH_CAP_EXCEEDED`; zero rows written (transactional rollback).
6. **`compliance-merkle-batch-mixed-meaning.spec.ts`** — batch with mixed `signature_meaning` rejected with `MERKLE_BATCH_MIXED_MEANING`.
7. **`compliance-merkle-batch-concurrency.spec.ts`** — 5 concurrent 50-leaf batches; each contributes exactly one `merkle_root` chain row; chain remains linear (assert N+1 chain rows with no fork on `previous_hash`); reuses Plan Fix 41 reproducer shape.
8. **`compliance-signer-snapshot.spec.ts`** — sign as `user-A`; later update `user-A.displayName`; replay leaf bytes from `signer_display_name_at_sign_time` (NOT current `users.display_name`); SHA-256 still matches `signature_chains.hash`.
9. **`compliance-authority-check.spec.ts`** — user lacking `compliance:signature:sign` gets canon §28 minimal 403 shape; `AccessAuditPort.logAccessDenied` row written.
10. **`compliance-reason-code-validator.spec.ts`** — pack with `requires_signature=true` collection and zero seeded reason codes is rejected by validator with `MISSING_REASON_CODE_FOR_CLOSURE_SIGNATURE`.
11. **`compliance-evidence-attach-roundtrip.spec.ts`** — upload photo to LocalStack S3 with COMPLIANCE retention; read back via signed URL; SHA-256 matches; `retention_until = captured_at + 7 years`; `s3_retention_mode = 'COMPLIANCE'`.
12. **`compliance-evidence-legal-hold.spec.ts`** — apply hold; advance `retention_until` to the past; RetentionSweepService runs; artifact NOT deleted. Release hold; sweep runs; artifact deleted from index (S3 object enforces COMPLIANCE separately).
13. **`compliance-evidence-tamper-detect.spec.ts`** — mutate S3 object out-of-band; `fetchSignedDownloadUrl` returns; client computes SHA-256 of downloaded bytes → does NOT match `evidence_artifacts.sha256`; reporting hook fires.
14. **`compliance-attestation-export-roundtrip.spec.ts`** — enqueue export for a record with 3 signatures + 1 Merkle batch of 50 actions + 5 evidence artifacts; worker completes; PDF generated; JSON contains chain proof; manifest enumerates all 5 artifact URIs; bundle itself becomes an `evidence_artifact` (recursive proof). Total chain-replay walk: 3 + 1 + 5 = 9 chain rows verified.
15. **`compliance-scanner-coverage.spec.ts`** — service-boundary scanner: writing to `electronic_signatures` from a file NOT in the allowed-writers list fails. audit-bypass scanner: batched insert on `signature_chains` WITHOUT `@AuditMerkleBatchInsert` marker fails.

Self-test count: 15 integration tests × ≥ 1 primary assertion each, plus ≥ 5 assertions in the `audit-bypass-check.ts` self-test for the new allowlist entry. Total ≥ 20 new assertions in the §3.6 acceptance lattice.

### 13.8 Worked example: §3.7 Mobile Runtime Parity + UI Primitives (full artifact-level spec — Elevator Mode + offline e-signature queue + per-collection WatermelonDB versioning)

#### 13.8.1 Tables

Three new tables in `schema: 'metadata'`, plus one new column on the existing `metadata.collection_definitions` table.

**`metadata.collection_definitions`** — gains one column:

| Column | Type | Default | Nullable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `sync_to_mobile` | `boolean` | `false` | NOT NULL | When `true`, this collection participates in mobile sync; pack validator (§13.8.7 G8.1) requires a matching `mobile_sync_policies` row |

**`metadata.mobile_sync_policies`** — one row per sync-eligible collection.

| Column | Type | Default | Nullable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | `uuid` | `gen_random_uuid()` | NOT NULL | PK |
| `collection_id` | `uuid` | — | NOT NULL | UNIQUE; FK → `metadata.collection_definitions(id) ON DELETE RESTRICT` (canon §14 — refuse delete if a policy exists) |
| `pull_scope` | `varchar(32)` | `'assigned_only'` | NOT NULL | CHECK ∈ `{full, assigned_only, recent_only}`. `full`: every readable record. `assigned_only`: where assignee = current_user. `recent_only`: last 30 days of `updated_at` |
| `pull_recent_window_days` | `int` | `30` | NOT NULL | Only relevant when `pull_scope = 'recent_only'`; CHECK `pull_recent_window_days BETWEEN 1 AND 365` |
| `conflict_strategy_header` | `varchar(32)` | `'server_wins'` | NOT NULL | CHECK ∈ `{server_wins, client_wins, last_write_wins, operator_review}` |
| `conflict_strategy_completion` | `varchar(32)` | `'last_write_wins'` | NOT NULL | Same enum; default `last_write_wins` per §3.7 founder ruling |
| `header_field_codes` | `varchar(120)[]` | `'{}'::varchar[]` | NOT NULL | Property codes treated as header for conflict-strategy purposes; remaining properties are completion fields |
| `field_permission_masking` | `boolean` | `true` | NOT NULL | When `true`, masked fields are absent from mobile payload entirely (canon §28 most-restrictive); when `false`, mobile receives the masked string |
| `is_active` | `boolean` | `true` | NOT NULL | Deactivation halts new pull deltas; existing local DBs unaffected |
| `created_at` | `timestamptz` | `now()` | NOT NULL | — |
| `updated_at` | `timestamptz` | `now()` | NOT NULL | Trigger-maintained |

Indexes: PK; UNIQUE `(collection_id)`; `ix_msp_active ON (is_active) WHERE is_active = true`.

**`metadata.mobile_sync_conflicts`** — operator review queue. One row per detected conflict.

| Column | Type | Default | Nullable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | `uuid` | `gen_random_uuid()` | NOT NULL | PK |
| `collection_id` | `uuid` | — | NOT NULL | FK |
| `record_id` | `uuid` | — | NOT NULL | The collided record |
| `field_code` | `varchar(120)` | — | NULL | NULL = whole-record conflict (record was deleted server-side and edited client-side); non-NULL = specific property |
| `detected_at` | `timestamptz` | `now()` | NOT NULL | — |
| `client_user_id` | `uuid` | — | NOT NULL | FK → `identity.users(id)`; who made the offending client write |
| `client_value` | `jsonb` | — | NOT NULL | Client's submitted value (or `null` JSON for delete-vs-edit conflicts) |
| `server_value` | `jsonb` | — | NOT NULL | Server's value at conflict-detection time |
| `client_value_at_timestamp` | `timestamptz` | — | NOT NULL | When the client believed it was writing (offline-capture clock) |
| `server_value_at_timestamp` | `timestamptz` | — | NOT NULL | When the server's value was last written |
| `strategy_applied` | `varchar(32)` | — | NOT NULL | CHECK ∈ `{server_wins, client_wins, last_write_wins, operator_review}`; what the policy selected |
| `auto_resolved` | `boolean` | `false` | NOT NULL | `true` if `strategy_applied ≠ 'operator_review'`; row is informational |
| `resolved_at` | `timestamptz` | — | NULL | Set when operator review closes; for auto-resolved rows equals `detected_at` |
| `resolved_by` | `uuid` | — | NULL | FK → `identity.users(id)` for `operator_review` |
| `resolution_choice` | `varchar(16)` | — | NULL | CHECK ∈ `{client, server, manual}`; `manual` means operator entered a third value, captured in `manual_value` |
| `manual_value` | `jsonb` | — | NULL | Only when `resolution_choice = 'manual'` |
| `audit_log_id` | `uuid` | — | NOT NULL | UNIQUE; FK |

Indexes: PK; `ix_msc_record ON (collection_id, record_id, detected_at DESC)`; `ix_msc_open ON (strategy_applied) WHERE strategy_applied = 'operator_review' AND resolved_at IS NULL`; `ix_msc_client ON (client_user_id, detected_at DESC)`.

**`metadata.mobile_collection_schemas`** — per-collection WatermelonDB schema versioning (founder-locked per-collection-hash strategy 2026-05-17).

| Column | Type | Default | Nullable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | `uuid` | `gen_random_uuid()` | NOT NULL | PK |
| `collection_id` | `uuid` | — | NOT NULL | UNIQUE; FK → `metadata.collection_definitions(id)` |
| `schema_hash` | `bytea` | — | NOT NULL | 32 bytes; SHA-256 over canonical property-set bytes (sorted by property `code`, NFC-normalized) |
| `watermelon_schema_json` | `jsonb` | — | NOT NULL | Generated WatermelonDB schema document — full column descriptors + decorators |
| `generated_at` | `timestamptz` | `now()` | NOT NULL | — |
| `properties_snapshot` | `jsonb` | — | NOT NULL | Snapshot of property metadata at generation time — replay-able for forensic schema diff |
| `audit_log_id` | `uuid` | — | NOT NULL | UNIQUE; FK |

Indexes: PK; UNIQUE `(collection_id)`; UNIQUE `(schema_hash)` — duplicate-hash detection across collections (same hash = identical schemas, useful for deduplication); `ix_mcs_generated ON (generated_at DESC)`.

#### 13.8.2 Partitioning strategy

None. `mobile_sync_conflicts` grows linearly but at the pilot scale (low thousands per month per instance) does not warrant partitioning. If hospital pilots produce > 50k conflict rows/year, a `mobile_sync_conflicts_archive_YYYY` annual partition follows the §13.7.2 pattern in a future plan-fix; flagged in §13.8.10 PR-6 acceptance.

`mobile_collection_schemas` carries one row per collection per instance — bounded by collection count (~70 in a fully-loaded customer with all 4 packs installed).

#### 13.8.3 Migrations

| # | Filename | Action |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `1933000000000-add-sync-to-mobile-column.ts` | `ALTER TABLE metadata.collection_definitions ADD COLUMN sync_to_mobile boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false;` |
| 2 | `1933000000001-create-mobile-sync-policies.ts` | Table + indexes; FK `ON DELETE RESTRICT` to enforce canon §14 reference-checking on collection delete |
| 3 | `1933000000002-create-mobile-sync-conflicts.ts` | Table + indexes |
| 4 | `1933000000003-create-mobile-collection-schemas.ts` | Table + indexes; `updated_at` trigger |

All migrations: `static transaction = false` where `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` is used (per W6.A `createIndexConcurrent`).

#### 13.8.4 TypeORM entities

Added to `libs/instance-db/src/lib/entities/metadata.ts` (existing area file per W6.A area-split pattern):

```typescript
@Entity({ schema: 'metadata', name: 'mobile_sync_policies' })
export class MobileSyncPolicy {
  @PrimaryGeneratedColumn('uuid') id!: string;
  @Column({ type: 'uuid' }) collectionId!: string;
  @Column({ type: 'varchar', length: 32, default: 'assigned_only' })
  pullScope!: 'full' | 'assigned_only' | 'recent_only';
  @Column({ type: 'int', default: 30 }) pullRecentWindowDays!: number;

#### 13.8.5 Packages + UI primitive vocabulary

Three new npm packages under `libs/`:

- **`@hubblewave/ui-primitives`** (`libs/ui-primitives/`) — TypeScript types + primitive declarations. No runtime; pure vocabulary. Every primitive is a `PrimitiveDescriptor` carrying `{ name, props: TypeBox schema, supportedSurfaces: ['web', 'mobile'], ... }`. The package exports the constant `PRIMITIVE_REGISTRY: Record<string, PrimitiveDescriptor>` enumerating every supported primitive.
- **`@hubblewave/ui-primitives-web`** (`libs/ui-primitives-web/`) — React + MUI + Tailwind adapter. Exports one React component per primitive with the same name (`Stack`, `Field`, `Card`, `SwipeProgressCard`, ...). Web variants of field-tool primitives degrade gracefully (e.g., `SwipeProgressCard` on web uses pointer-drag instead of touch-swipe).
- **`@hubblewave/ui-primitives-mobile`** (`libs/ui-primitives-mobile/`) — React Native + Reanimated 3 adapter. Same export names, RN-native gestures.

Foundation primitives: `Stack`, `Field`, `Card`, `List`, `ActionBar`, `Chart`, `Signature`.
Capture primitives: `MediaCapture`, `BarcodeScanner`, `NameplateCamera` (LLM-OCR-backed nameplate identification).
Field-tool primitives: `SwipeProgressCard`, `ThumbToggle`, `LargeActionButton` (minimum 64dp tap target enforced via Reanimated layout measure on mobile, MUI `sx={{ minHeight: 64 }}` on web).

The `PRIMITIVE_REGISTRY` is the single source of truth for the `ui-primitive-parity-check` scanner (§13.8.9).

#### 13.8.6 Services

`apps/api/src/app/mobile/` (new module).

**`MobileCollectionSchemaService`** — `apps/api/src/app/mobile/schema/mobile-collection-schema.service.ts`:

```typescript
computeSchemaHash(collectionId: string, ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<{ hash: Buffer; schema: WatermelonSchema }>;
publishSchema(collectionId: string, ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<MobileCollectionSchema>;
listManifest(ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<Array<{ collectionId: string; hashHex: string; generatedAt: string }>>;
```

`computeSchemaHash(...)` walks the collection's properties (filtered to non-masked-for-requestor per canon §28); canonicalizes (sort by property `code`, NFC-normalize property labels, RFC 3339 timestamps); computes SHA-256. `publishSchema(...)` writes the row inside `withAudit(...)` so the schema-publish event is auditable.

Schema regeneration runs on:
- Pack install (every sync-eligible collection)
- `collection_definitions.sync_to_mobile` flip from `false → true`
- Property add/update/delete on a sync-eligible collection (via `MetadataEventBus.on('property.modified')`)

**`MobileSyncService`** — `apps/api/src/app/mobile/sync/mobile-sync.service.ts`:

```typescript
pull(input: PullRequest, ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<PullResponse>;
push(input: PushRequest, ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<PushResponse>;
```

`pull(...)` flow:
1. Validate `lastPullCursor` per collection; cursor is `(updated_at, id)` pair.
2. For each collection in scope, apply `pull_scope` filter (full / assigned_only / recent_only); intersect with canon §28 record visibility (`AuthorizationService.filterReadable`).
3. For each readable record, apply canon §28 field-level decision; emit fields per `field_permission_masking` policy (omit on `true`, mask on `false`).
4. Return `{ deltas: { [collectionId]: { upserts: [], deletes: [], nextCursor } } }`.

`push(...)` flow per submitted write:
1. Authorization check via `AuthorizationService.canPerformAction`; deny → 403 minimal shape + AccessAuditPort.logAccessDenied. Whole-push fails on first deny (no partial commits).
2. Read server row at version `clientBaseVersionAtTimestamp`.
3. Conflict detection per field: if `serverRow.updated_at > clientBaseVersionAtTimestamp` AND fields overlap → resolve per `mobile_sync_policies.conflict_strategy_*`. The same strategy is applied online and offline (founder-locked 2026-05-17).
4. Auto-resolved conflicts: emit `mobile_sync_conflicts` row with `auto_resolved=true, strategy_applied=<resolved-strategy>`. Operator-review conflicts emit row with `auto_resolved=false`; the client write is REJECTED with 409 + the conflict ID.
5. Apply non-conflicting + resolved-in-client-favor writes inside `withAudit(...)`.
6. Return `{ accepted: [recordId], conflicts: [{recordId, conflictId, strategyApplied}] }`.

**`MobileSyncConflictService`** — `apps/api/src/app/mobile/sync/mobile-sync-conflict.service.ts`:

```typescript
listOpenConflicts(filter: ConflictFilter, ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<MobileSyncConflict[]>;
resolveConflict(conflictId: string, choice: 'client' | 'server' | 'manual', manualValue?: unknown, ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<void>;
```

`resolveConflict(...)` applies the chosen value via `DataRecordService.update` inside `withAudit(...)` (the record update is audit-logged as a separate row from the conflict resolution); marks the conflict row resolved.

**`OfflineSignatureQueueService`** — `apps/api/src/app/mobile/signature/offline-signature-queue.service.ts`:

```typescript
ingestQueuedSignatures(input: QueuedSignatureBatch, ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<QueueIngestResult>;
confirmQueuedBatch(input: { batchId: string; webauthnAssertion: WebAuthnAssertion }, ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<BatchConfirmResult>;
```

Contract (closes the §3.6 ↔ §3.7 tension, founder-locked 2026-05-17):

`ingestQueuedSignatures(...)`:
1. Receives N queued signatures from the client (each with `local_signature_id`, full canonical payload, `signed_at_utc` from the device clock, `signature_meaning`).
2. Validates authority + reason-code per signature (per §13.7.5).
3. Writes intermediate rows to a new transient queue table `compliance.offline_signature_queue` (out of scope for §13.8.1 detail; covered in PR-7 acceptance) with status `pending_reauth`. No `electronic_signatures` rows written yet.
4. Returns `{ batchId, queuedCount }`. Client UI shows the batched "Awaiting confirm" badge.

`confirmQueuedBatch(...)`:
1. Validates the presented WebAuthn assertion (fresh, < 60s) via `WebAuthnService.verifyAssertion`.
2. If valid, invokes `MerkleBatchService.batchSign(...)` with the queue's actions as one batch — Merkle root binds every queued signature cryptographically. Existing 256-leaf cap applies; queues over 256 split into ceiling(N/256) batches confirmed sequentially under the same WebAuthn assertion.
3. Deletes the `compliance.offline_signature_queue` rows on successful Merkle batch commit.
4. Returns `{ confirmedSignatures: [...], merkleRootChainEntryId }`.

The deferred-reauth path is auditor-safe because: (a) signatures don't enter `electronic_signatures` until the WebAuthn challenge confirms them, so a "signature" in the audit trail still carries fresh re-auth evidence; (b) the offline_signature_queue rows carry the device clock `signed_at_utc` plus the server clock `enqueued_at_utc` so post-hoc reconstruction shows the timeline accurately; (c) the queue is bounded — if a technician never reconnects, queued signatures eventually expire and the client surfaces "Pending signatures could not be confirmed" with the full action list for manual replay.

#### 13.8.7 API endpoints

| Method | Path | Boundary | Body / params |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/mobile/sync/manifest` | `@AuthenticatedOnly()` | — returns array of `{ collectionId, schemaHashHex, pullScope, fieldPermissionMasking }` |
| `GET` | `/api/mobile/schemas/:collectionId` | `@RequireCollectionAccess('read')` | — returns full `watermelonSchemaJson` |
| `POST` | `/api/mobile/sync/pull` | `@AuthenticatedOnly()` | `{ collections: [{ collectionId, lastPullCursor }] }` returns delta payload |
| `POST` | `/api/mobile/sync/push` | `@AuthenticatedOnly()` | `{ writes: [{ collectionId, recordId, clientBaseVersionAt, fields }] }` returns `{ accepted, conflicts }` |
| `GET` | `/api/mobile/sync/conflicts` | `@RequirePermission('mobile:sync:conflict:read')` | query: `collectionId?`, `status?`, `assignee?` |
| `POST` | `/api/mobile/sync/conflicts/:id/resolve` | `@RequirePermission('mobile:sync:conflict:resolve')` | `{ choice: 'client'\|'server'\|'manual', manualValue? }` |
| `POST` | `/api/mobile/sync/queued-signatures` | `@RequirePermission('compliance:signature:sign')` | `{ signatures: [...queued] }` returns `{ batchId, queuedCount }` |
| `POST` | `/api/mobile/sync/queued-signatures/:batchId/confirm` | `@RequirePermission('compliance:signature:sign')` | `{ webauthnAssertion }` returns `{ confirmedSignatures, merkleRootChainEntryId }` |
| `POST` | `/api/mobile/sync/queued-signatures/:batchId/abandon` | `@RequirePermission('compliance:signature:sign')` | — drops the queued batch; emits high-severity audit |

Permission codes added to `PERMISSION_REGISTRY`:
- `mobile:sync:conflict:read`, `mobile:sync:conflict:resolve`

(`compliance:signature:sign` already exists from §13.7 — reused here.)

`/api/mobile/sync/pull` and `/api/mobile/sync/push` are `@AuthenticatedOnly()` rather than `@RequirePermission` because per-record + per-field §28 authorization happens INSIDE the service, not at the boundary; the boundary just confirms a valid user session.

#### 13.8.8 Validator extensions

Pack validator gains 4 new publish gates:

1. **G8.1** — Any `collection_definitions.sync_to_mobile = true` MUST have a corresponding `mobile_sync_policies` row. Error: `MISSING_MOBILE_SYNC_POLICY`.
2. **G8.2** — Every `mobile_sync_policies.header_field_codes[]` value MUST resolve to an existing property `code` on the same collection. Error: `INVALID_HEADER_FIELD_CODE`.
3. **G8.3** — `mobile_sync_policies.conflict_strategy_*` MUST be in the canonical enum. Error: `INVALID_CONFLICT_STRATEGY`.
4. **G8.4** — Any `FormDefinition` published on a `sync_to_mobile=true` collection MUST use only primitives whose `PRIMITIVE_REGISTRY[name].supportedSurfaces` includes `'mobile'`. Error: `MOBILE_INELIGIBLE_PRIMITIVE` (lists the offending primitive + form path).

Frontend lint rule additions (`tools/eslint-rules/`):
- `hw/no-direct-mui-import-in-mobile-form` — files in `apps/mobile/src/forms/` MUST NOT import from `@mui/material` directly; must use `@hubblewave/ui-primitives-mobile`. Error level.

#### 13.8.9 Service-boundary scanner rules + new parity scanner

`tools/service-boundary-check.ts` `KNOWN_WRITES` table gains:

| Entity | Allowed writers |
|---|---|
| `MobileSyncPolicy` | `MobileSyncPolicyService.*`, `PackInstaller.installMobileSyncPolicies` |
| `MobileSyncConflict` | `MobileSyncService.push`, `MobileSyncConflictService.resolveConflict` |
| `MobileCollectionSchema` | `MobileCollectionSchemaService.publishSchema` |

`tools/ui-primitive-parity-check.ts` (NEW scanner, founder-locked 2026-05-17):
- Reads `PRIMITIVE_REGISTRY` from `@hubblewave/ui-primitives`.
- Globs the public export surface of `@hubblewave/ui-primitives-web/src/index.ts` and `@hubblewave/ui-primitives-mobile/src/index.ts`.
- For each entry in the registry: BOTH adapters MUST export a symbol matching the primitive name. Asymmetric exports fail CI with `PRIMITIVE_PARITY_VIOLATION: <name> exported from -web only` or vice versa.
- Self-test: 8 assertions covering (a) registered + both exported → pass; (b) registered + web-only → fail; (c) registered + mobile-only → fail; (d) unregistered + both exported → flagged as orphan; (e) registered + neither exported → fail; (f) primitive renamed on one side → fail; (g) export-default vs named-export distinction handled; (h) self-test stable across Windows + Linux paths.

`tools/elevator-mode-check.ts` (NEW scanner, founder-locked 2026-05-17):
- Greps `apps/mobile/src/` for action handlers (functions matching `on[A-Z]\w+` exported from `actions.ts` files).
- Flags any handler whose body starts with `await fetch(` / `await api.` BEFORE a WatermelonDB write (regex check on the first non-comment statement).
- Codifies the Elevator Mode invariant: local optimistic write MUST happen before any network call.
- Allowlist entry per legitimate exception (read-only refresh actions, etc.); allowlist tagged with `followUp` notes for review.

#### 13.8.10 Tests (self-test ≥ 18 assertions)

Integration + e2e tests at `apps/api/test/integration/mobile-*.spec.ts` and `apps/mobile/test/e2e/elevator-mode-*.spec.ts`:

1. **`mobile-semantic-equivalence.spec.ts`** — same `FormDefinition` JSON rendered via `@hubblewave/ui-primitives-web` and via `@hubblewave/ui-primitives-mobile`; assert (a) field set identical, (b) visibility rules emit identical computed booleans for the same record, (c) permission gates emit identical hidden-field sets.
2. **`mobile-collection-schema-hash-stable.spec.ts`** — same collection content → same `schema_hash` across two `computeSchemaHash` calls.
3. **`mobile-collection-schema-hash-detects-change.spec.ts`** — add a property → hash changes; remove the property → hash returns to original value (deterministic).
4. **`mobile-sync-pull-scope-assigned-only.spec.ts`** — user A pulls; receives only records where `assignee_id = A`; user B pulls same collection; receives B's records.
5. **`mobile-sync-pull-field-permission-masking.spec.ts`** — user with masked-field policy on `salary` pulls; record arrives WITHOUT the `salary` field key (masked-as-omission per `field_permission_masking=true`).
6. **`mobile-sync-push-server-wins-header.spec.ts`** — client offline edits header field; server modified header in parallel; push reconciles to server value; `mobile_sync_conflicts` row written with `auto_resolved=true, strategy_applied='server_wins'`.
7. **`mobile-sync-push-lww-completion.spec.ts`** — client offline edits a completion field with `signed_at_utc` AFTER server's last update → client wins; conflicts row records the resolution.
8. **`mobile-sync-push-operator-review.spec.ts`** — collection configured with `conflict_strategy_header='operator_review'`; client push collides; 409 returned with conflict ID; row appears in `MobileSyncConflictService.listOpenConflicts`.
9. **`mobile-sync-push-authorization-deny.spec.ts`** — user pushes a write to a record they lack `update` permission on; entire push rejected with canon §28 minimal 403 shape; no rows committed; `AccessAuditPort.logAccessDenied` row written.
10. **`mobile-sync-pull-cursor-resume.spec.ts`** — pull twice; first call returns 50 rows + cursor; second call resumes from cursor and returns next 50 + null cursor.
11. **`mobile-offline-signature-queue.spec.ts`** — client queues 3 closure signatures offline; calls `/queued-signatures` (stored in `offline_signature_queue` as `pending_reauth`); presents WebAuthn assertion via `/confirm`; `MerkleBatchService.batchSign` produces ONE `signature_chains` merkle_root row + 3 `electronic_signatures` rows; queue rows deleted; total chain extension = 1 row.
12. **`mobile-offline-signature-queue-abandon.spec.ts`** — queue 2 signatures; abandon batch; rows deleted; high-severity audit row written; zero `electronic_signatures` created.
13. **`mobile-offline-signature-256-split.spec.ts`** — queue 300 signatures; single WebAuthn confirm splits into 2 Merkle batches (256 + 44 leaves); each is a separate `signature_chains` merkle_root row; chain remains linear.
14. **`mobile-primitive-parity-scanner.spec.ts`** — temporarily remove a primitive from `-mobile`; scanner CI exits non-zero with `PRIMITIVE_PARITY_VIOLATION`; restore; scanner passes.
15. **`mobile-elevator-mode-scanner.spec.ts`** — temporarily add `await api.x()` before WatermelonDB write in a mobile action handler; scanner CI exits non-zero; revert; passes.
16. **`mobile-elevator-mode-acceptance.spec.ts`** — full e2e in iOS simulator with network disabled: open WO list → swipe through states → complete checklist → capture photo → e-sign (queued) → close. Re-enable network; sync flushes; all writes commit + queued signature confirmed via WebAuthn modal.
17. **`mobile-sync-conflict-policy-online.spec.ts`** — two browser sessions edit the same record concurrently while both online; second write triggers conflict per same policy as offline path (founder-locked 2026-05-17); conflict row written.
18. **`mobile-collection-delete-blocks-on-policy.spec.ts`** — attempt to delete a collection that has a `mobile_sync_policies` row → blocked by canon §14 reference-checking; structured "in-use" error lists the policy.

Self-test count: 18 integration tests × ≥ 1 primary assertion + 8 assertions on the parity scanner self-test + 6 on the elevator-mode scanner self-test = ≥ 32 new assertions in the §3.7 acceptance lattice.

### 13.9 Worked example: §3.8 AVA Runtime UI Synthesis (full artifact-level spec — Invisible Manual + transient FormDefinition rendering)

#### 13.9.1 Tables

No new persistent tables (request-scoped synthesis per §3.8 prose). Three additive columns on the existing `ava.ava_proposals` entity (canon §11/§12):

**`ava.ava_proposals`** — gains three columns:

| Column | Type | Default | Nullable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `synthesis_kind` | `varchar(64)` | — | NULL | Set when proposal carries a synthesized `FormDefinition`; values e.g. `troubleshooting_checklist`, `manual_excerpt_form`, `inline_diagnostic_grid` |
| `synthesized_form_def` | `jsonb` | — | NULL | Full `FormDefinition` JSON; rendered by client via `@hubblewave/ui-primitives` |
| `validator_passed` | `boolean` | — | NULL | `true` when `FormDefinitionValidator.validate()` returned no errors; `false` when synthesis was refused (proposal still recorded for canon §12 traceability — the auditor sees what AVA *tried* to render even when refused) |

Index: `ix_ava_synthesis_kind ON (synthesis_kind) WHERE synthesis_kind IS NOT NULL` — partial; supports "show me all troubleshooting synthesis attempts in the last week" queries.

#### 13.9.2 Migrations

| # | Filename | Action |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `1934000000000-add-ava-proposal-synthesis-columns.ts` | `ALTER TABLE ava.ava_proposals ADD COLUMN synthesis_kind varchar(64) NULL, ADD COLUMN synthesized_form_def jsonb NULL, ADD COLUMN validator_passed boolean NULL;` + index via `createIndexConcurrent` |

#### 13.9.3 Services

`apps/api/src/app/ava/synthesis/` (new submodule under existing `ava` module).

**`AvaFormSynthesisService`** — `apps/api/src/app/ava/synthesis/ava-form-synthesis.service.ts`:

```typescript
synthesize(input: SynthesisRequest, ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<SynthesisResult>;
```

`SynthesisRequest` carries `{ toolName: string; toolInput: Record<string, unknown>; targetCollectionId?: string; targetRecordId?: string; }`. Flow:
1. Resolve the registered `AVATool` by `toolName`; refuse with 404 if unknown. Every synthesis tool is gated through canon §12 trust progression — the tool's `trust_state` column (existing) determines whether the result auto-renders (`execute`) or requires a Preview confirmation (`suggest`/`preview`).
2. Invoke the tool's handler (registered by the pack at boot via `AVAToolRegistry.register({ name, handler, trust_state })`). Handler returns a candidate `FormDefinition` JSON.
3. Pass the candidate through `FormDefinitionValidator.validate(candidate, { synthesisMode: true })`. The validator is the SAME one pack-shipped forms use — only `@hubblewave/ui-primitives` primitive names allowed, no escape hatches. Synthesis-mode adds two additional rules: (a) max 20 fields, (b) max nested depth of 3 (prevents AVA from emitting a UI bomb).
4. Write an `AVAProposal` row inside `withAudit(...)` with `synthesis_kind`, `synthesized_form_def` (if validator passed), `validator_passed = boolean`. The trust-state policy determines `proposal_state`: `execute` → `applied`; `suggest`/`preview` → `pending_review`.
5. Return `{ proposalId, formDef?, validatorErrors?, trustState }`.

The handler-emitted `FormDefinition` is NEVER persisted to `metadata.form_definitions` — pack-shipped vs synthesized forms are distinct surfaces. Persisted forms come through pack publishers; synthesized forms render-and-vanish via the proposal row.

**`FormDefinitionValidator`** — extended (existing service from §3.7 G8.4):

```typescript
validate(formDef: FormDefinition, options?: { synthesisMode?: boolean }): ValidationResult;
```

Synthesis mode additionally enforces field-count + depth caps. Errors emit structured codes: `SYNTHESIS_FIELD_CAP_EXCEEDED`, `SYNTHESIS_NEST_DEPTH_EXCEEDED`.

#### 13.9.4 API endpoints

| Method | Path | Boundary | Body / params |
|---|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/api/ava/synthesize` | `@RequirePermission('ava:synthesis:invoke')` | `{ toolName, toolInput, targetCollectionId?, targetRecordId? }` returns `{ proposalId, formDef?, validatorErrors?, trustState }` |
| `GET` | `/api/ava/proposals/:id/synthesis` | `@RequirePermission('ava:proposal:read')` | — returns the persisted `synthesized_form_def` for audit/replay |

New permission codes in `PERMISSION_REGISTRY`:
- `ava:synthesis:invoke`
- `ava:proposal:read` (reused from canon §11)

#### 13.9.5 Validator extensions

Pack validator gains 2 publish gates:

1. **G9.1** — Pack `ava_tools[]` declarations MUST resolve to functions exported by the pack's `ava-tools/` directory; registration signature `AVAToolRegistry.register({ name, handler, trust_state })`. Error: `MISSING_AVA_TOOL_HANDLER`.
2. **G9.2** — Every `ava_tools[].trust_state` MUST be in `{suggest, preview, execute}` per canon §12 per-feature trust progression. Error: `INVALID_TRUST_STATE`.

#### 13.9.6 Service-boundary scanner rules

Writes to `ava.ava_proposals` already restricted to `AvaProposalService`; allow `AvaFormSynthesisService` in `tools/service-boundary-check.ts` `KNOWN_WRITES`. No new entity-writer rules.

#### 13.9.7 Tests (self-test ≥ 10 assertions)

Integration tests at `apps/api/test/integration/ava-synthesis-*.spec.ts`:

1. **`ava-synthesis-happy-path.spec.ts`** — register `synthesizeTroubleshootingChecklist`; invoke via API; validator passes; proposal row written with `synthesis_kind` + `synthesized_form_def`.
2. **`ava-synthesis-validator-refuses-non-primitive.spec.ts`** — tool emits `FormDefinition` referencing primitive `LegacyMuiButton` (not in `PRIMITIVE_REGISTRY`); validator rejects; proposal row written with `validator_passed=false` and `synthesized_form_def=null`; API response 422 with structured error.
3. **`ava-synthesis-field-cap-exceeded.spec.ts`** — tool emits 25 fields; validator rejects with `SYNTHESIS_FIELD_CAP_EXCEEDED`; proposal still written.
4. **`ava-synthesis-nest-depth-exceeded.spec.ts`** — tool emits 4-level-nested Stack; rejects with `SYNTHESIS_NEST_DEPTH_EXCEEDED`.
5. **`ava-synthesis-trust-state-suggest.spec.ts`** — tool registered with `trust_state='suggest'`; result `proposal_state = pending_review`; UI must call `confirmProposal` before render.
6. **`ava-synthesis-trust-state-execute.spec.ts`** — same but `trust_state='execute'`; `proposal_state='applied'`; UI renders directly.
7. **`ava-synthesis-authorization.spec.ts`** — user without `ava:synthesis:invoke` gets canon §28 minimal 403; `AccessAuditPort.logAccessDenied` row written.
8. **`ava-synthesis-mobile-primitive-only.spec.ts`** — synthesis on a `sync_to_mobile=true` collection refuses primitives whose `supportedSurfaces` lacks `'mobile'`; reuses §13.8 G8.4.
9. **`ava-synthesis-canon12-audit.spec.ts`** — every synthesis call (passed AND refused) writes one `audit_logs` row; payload includes tool name + validator result.
10. **`ava-synthesis-validator-mode-symmetry.spec.ts`** — same `FormDefinition` passes both pack-validator and synthesis-validator; only synthesis-mode additions are field-cap + nest-depth. Regression test for validator drift.

#### 13.10.3 Services

`apps/api/src/app/intake/` (new module) + `apps/worker/src/intake/` (new module).

**`PublicIntakeTokenService`** — API side; issues + revokes tokens.
- `issue(input: IssueTokenRequest, ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<PublicIntakeToken>` — issuance requires `intake:token:issue` permission; writes via `withAudit`.
- `revoke(tokenId: string, reason: string, ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<void>` — one-tap revoke; writes high-severity audit if `reason='abuse_detected'`.
- `quarantineAsset(collectionId: string, recordId: string, ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<void>` — revokes ALL tokens scoped to that record AND blocks future issuance via `intake_asset_quarantine` flag (new column on `collection_records` — out of scope to add for §13.10; tracked as PR-3 acceptance dependency).

**`PublicIntakeSubmissionController`** — `apps/api/src/app/intake/public-intake.controller.ts`. Public endpoints (`@Public` decorator, but per-route rate-limited):
- `POST /api/public/intake/:tokenCode/submit` — single-step JSON submission. Validates token (not revoked, not expired, uses < max_uses); validates payload against the pack-declared schema for `token.purpose`; computes ip_hash + ua_hash + geo_country_code; emits `RuntimeAnomaly` row if (a) rate-limit breached, (b) geo-anomaly detected (token issued in country X but submission from country Y for `quarterly_rotate` tokens). Returns `{ submissionCode }` and NEVER any operational data.
- `POST /api/public/intake/:tokenCode/attachment-url` — pre-signed S3 upload URL. Per-attachment scope. Returns `{ attachmentId, presignedUrl, expiresAt }`.

**`PublicIntakeProcessor`** — worker side; `apps/worker/src/intake/public-intake.processor.ts`. On BullMQ job pickup:
1. Wait for ALL attachments referenced by the submission to reach `scan_status='clean'`; if any hits `quarantined`, mark the submission `outcome='refused_scan_failed'`, emit `RuntimeAnomaly`, stop.
2. Run AVA structured extraction via the pack-declared handler for `token.purpose`; output goes to `structured_payload` + creates an `AVAProposal` row.
3. Dispatch to the pack action handler under a system principal scoped to `intake:dispatch:<purpose>` (system principal is the canon §29.7 service-principal mechanism); the pack creates the target record (e.g., a Work Order from a walk-by nurse intake) and writes `resolved_collection_id` + `resolved_record_id` back onto the submission.
4. Stamp `outcome='processed'` + `processed_at`.

**`AttachmentScanProcessor`** — worker side; runs AV + secret-scan + PII-scan + content-hash pipeline on each attachment upload. Reuses §3.12 Storage runtime infrastructure (PR-5 acceptance documents the dependency).

#### 13.10.4 API endpoints

| Method | Path | Boundary | Body / params |
|---|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/api/intake/tokens` | `@RequirePermission('intake:token:issue')` | `{ purpose, scopeCollectionId, scopeRecordId?, expiresAt, maxUses?, rotationPolicy? }` |
| `DELETE` | `/api/intake/tokens/:id` | `@RequirePermission('intake:token:revoke')` | `{ reason }` |
| `POST` | `/api/intake/assets/:collectionId/:recordId/quarantine` | `@RequirePermission('intake:asset:quarantine')` | `{ reason }` |
| `GET` | `/api/intake/submissions` | `@RequirePermission('intake:submission:read')` | query: `tokenId?`, `outcome?` |
| `POST` | `/api/public/intake/:tokenCode/submit` | `@Public()` (per-token + per-IP rate-limited) | `{ clientIdempotencyUuid, payload, attachments?: [{attachmentId}] }` returns `{ submissionCode }` |
| `POST` | `/api/public/intake/:tokenCode/attachment-url` | `@Public()` (per-token rate-limited) | `{ filename, contentType, sizeBytes }` returns `{ attachmentId, presignedUrl, expiresAt }` |

New permission codes: `intake:token:issue`, `intake:token:revoke`, `intake:asset:quarantine`, `intake:submission:read`. `intake:asset:quarantine` is `dangerous: true`.

#### 13.10.5 Validator extensions

Pack validator gains 5 publish gates:

1. **G10.1** — Pack `public_intake.schemas[]` MUST declare a JSON Schema for each purpose's payload. Error: `MISSING_INTAKE_SCHEMA`.
2. **G10.2** — Pack `public_intake.purposes[].dispatch_handler` MUST resolve to an exported function. Error: `MISSING_INTAKE_DISPATCH_HANDLER`.
3. **G10.3** — Pack `public_intake.purposes[].rotation_policy` MUST be in `{lifetime, quarterly_rotate}`. Error: `INVALID_ROTATION_POLICY`.
4. **G10.4** — When `public_intake.purposes[].record_bound = true`, token issuance MUST require `scope_record_id`. Error: `RECORD_BOUND_PURPOSE_MISSING_RECORD`.
5. **G10.5** — Pack `public_intake.purposes[].max_payload_kb` MUST be ≤ 50 (platform cap). Error: `PAYLOAD_CAP_EXCEEDED`.

#### 13.10.6 Service-boundary scanner rules

`tools/service-boundary-check.ts` `KNOWN_WRITES`:

| Entity | Allowed writers |
|---|---|
| `PublicIntakeToken` | `PublicIntakeTokenService.*` |
| `PublicIntakeSubmission` | `PublicIntakeSubmissionController.submit`, `PublicIntakeProcessor.process` |
| `PublicIntakeAttachment` | `PublicIntakeSubmissionController.requestAttachmentUrl`, `AttachmentScanProcessor.recordScanResult` |

Additionally added to `tools/security-bypass-check.ts` `PUBLIC_ALLOWLIST` (the two public endpoints under `/api/public/intake/`).

#### 13.10.7 Tests (self-test ≥ 15 assertions)

1. **`intake-token-issue-and-submit.spec.ts`** — issue token; submit valid payload; submission processed; pack dispatch creates target record; `resolved_record_id` populated.
2. **`intake-idempotency.spec.ts`** — submit twice with same `clientIdempotencyUuid`; second response returns identical `submissionCode`; only ONE submission row created.
3. **`intake-token-expired.spec.ts`** — token with `expires_at = past`; submit returns 410 generic message; submission row created with `outcome='refused_token_expired'`.
4. **`intake-token-revoked.spec.ts`** — issue + revoke; submit returns 410 generic; row with `outcome='refused_token_revoked'`.
5. **`intake-token-exhausted.spec.ts`** — `max_uses=1`; first submit OK; second returns 410; row with `outcome='refused_token_exhausted'`.
6. **`intake-rate-limit.spec.ts`** — 101 submissions/min from same IP hash; 100th OK, 101st returns 429; `RuntimeAnomaly` row written.
7. **`intake-attachment-clean-flow.spec.ts`** — request attachment URL; upload binary to LocalStack S3; scan transitions `pending → scanning → clean`; submission references attachment by `attachmentId`; processor proceeds.
8. **`intake-attachment-quarantined.spec.ts`** — AV scanner flags upload; `scan_status='quarantined'`; submission processor refuses + `outcome='refused_scan_failed'`; `RuntimeAnomaly` written.
9. **`intake-attachment-size-cap.spec.ts`** — upload 26MB attachment rejected with structured error; CHECK constraint trips.
10. **`intake-payload-size-cap.spec.ts`** — 51KB JSON payload rejected; G10.5-equivalent runtime check.
11. **`intake-no-data-leakage.spec.ts`** — submit; inspect response body and headers — contains ONLY `submissionCode`; no record IDs, no field values, no token metadata.
12. **`intake-geo-anomaly.spec.ts`** — token issued from US IP; submission from offshore IP; `RuntimeAnomaly` emitted with kind `intake_geo_anomaly`; submission still accepted (alert-only).
13. **`intake-asset-quarantine.spec.ts`** — quarantine asset; all asset-scoped tokens marked revoked; new token issuance for that scope refused with structured error.
14. **`intake-rotation-quarterly.spec.ts`** — token with `rotation_policy='quarterly_rotate'` advances `next_rotation_at`; cron job (apps/worker scheduled task) rotates code on the boundary; old code returns 410 thereafter; new code is delivered to the customer's rotation webhook.
15. **`intake-system-principal-dispatch.spec.ts`** — pack dispatch handler runs as system principal scoped to `intake:dispatch:<purpose>`; cannot escalate to write outside its declared collection scope; canon §29.7 audience binding enforced.

### 13.11 Worked example: §3.10 Break-Glass Field Override (full artifact-level spec — time-bound unmasking + hard-deny classes + canon §28.10)

#### 13.11.1 Tables + additive columns

Two additive columns on the existing `metadata.property_definitions` table, plus one new table in `schema: 'compliance'`.

**`metadata.property_definitions`** — gains two columns:

| Column | Type | Default | Nullable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `break_glass_eligible` | `boolean` | `false` | NOT NULL | When `true`, property can be unmasked via a time-bound grant (subject to confidentiality_class) |
| `confidentiality_class` | `varchar(64)` | `'internal'` | NOT NULL | CHECK ∈ `{public, internal, sensitive, never_reveal, legal_hold, sealed_investigation, system_secret, unrelated_patient_context}`; the five hard-deny values are mutually exclusive with `break_glass_eligible=true` (validator G11.1) |

Index: `ix_pd_break_glass ON (collection_id, break_glass_eligible) WHERE break_glass_eligible = true`.

**`compliance.field_unmask_grants`** — time-bound grant rows.

| Column | Type | Default | Nullable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | `uuid` | `gen_random_uuid()` | NOT NULL | PK |
| `instance_id` | `uuid` | — | NULL | Same posture |
| `principal_user_id` | `uuid` | — | NOT NULL | FK → `identity.users(id)`; the user receiving the unmask |
| `collection_id` | `uuid` | — | NOT NULL | FK |
| `record_id` | `uuid` | — | NOT NULL | The specific record |
| `property_id` | `uuid` | — | NOT NULL | FK → `metadata.property_definitions(id)`; CHECK at insert that `property.break_glass_eligible = true` AND `property.confidentiality_class NOT IN (hard-deny enum)` |
| `granted_at` | `timestamptz` | `now()` | NOT NULL | — |
| `granted_until` | `timestamptz` | — | NOT NULL | Bounded duration (default 10 minutes; per-pack policy may extend up to 60 minutes) |
| `reason_code_id` | `uuid` | — | NOT NULL | FK → `compliance.reason_codes(id)`; reason_code's `applicable_signature_meanings` must include `'break_glass'` (new meaning) OR the platform-default `platform__break_glass_phi_access` row |
| `signature_chain_entry_id` | `uuid` | — | NOT NULL | UNIQUE; FK → `compliance.signature_chains(id)`; binds the grant to the §13.7 compliance chain |
| `audit_log_id` | `uuid` | — | NOT NULL | UNIQUE; FK |
| `revoked_at` | `timestamptz` | — | NULL | Set by auto-revoker OR manual revoke |
| `revocation_reason` | `varchar(64)` | — | NULL | `auto_expired` / `manual_revoke` / `principal_session_ended` / `compromise_response` |
| `created_at` | `timestamptz` | `now()` | NOT NULL | — |

Indexes: PK; `ix_fug_active ON (principal_user_id, collection_id, record_id, property_id) WHERE revoked_at IS NULL AND granted_until > now()` — partial; this is the cache-bust target for `compliance:break_glass:grant:invalidate` events; `ix_fug_expiring ON (granted_until) WHERE revoked_at IS NULL` — for the auto-revoker sweep.

**§13.11 extends `compliance.reason_codes.applicable_signature_meanings` enum to include `'break_glass'`** (the signature meaning enum stays at 5 values; `break_glass` is an *applicable-meaning* tag distinct from the `signature_meaning` column on `electronic_signatures`). The signature row that authorizes a break-glass grant uses `signature_meaning='responsibility'` per the §13.7.5.1 matrix (so a fresh WebAuthn assertion is required), AND `reason_code.applicable_signature_meanings` must contain `'break_glass'`.

#### 13.11.3 Services

`apps/api/src/app/compliance/break-glass/` (new submodule under existing compliance module).

**`BreakGlassService`** — `apps/api/src/app/compliance/break-glass/break-glass.service.ts`:

```typescript
requestGrant(input: GrantRequest, ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<GrantResult>;
revokeGrant(grantId: string, reason: string, ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<void>;
listActiveGrants(filter: GrantFilter, ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<FieldUnmaskGrant[]>;
```

`requestGrant(...)` flow:
1. Resolve target `property_definitions` row. Refuse with structured error `BREAK_GLASS_PROPERTY_INELIGIBLE` if `break_glass_eligible=false` OR `confidentiality_class ∈ {never_reveal, legal_hold, sealed_investigation, system_secret, unrelated_patient_context}`. **The hard-deny class check is the first thing checked** — even if a misconfigured grant somehow reaches insert, the property-level eligibility check at evaluator time still wins.
2. Validate authority — user must hold `compliance:break_glass:request` permission AND have READ access to the record (i.e., can SEE the masked-or-omitted field; break-glass unmasks what the user already has row-visibility for).
3. Require fresh WebAuthn re-auth (per §13.7.5.1 `responsibility` tier; per-call, not session); reuse `WebAuthnService.verifyAssertion`.
4. Validate `reason_code_id` is active AND its `applicable_signature_meanings` includes `'break_glass'`.
5. Compute `granted_until = now() + min(requested_duration, 60 minutes, pack_policy.max_break_glass_duration)`. Default 10 minutes; pack manifest may declare a tighter cap per purpose.
6. Inside `withAudit(...)`:
   - Insert `electronic_signatures` row with `signature_meaning='responsibility'` and `reason_code_id` (binds the action to canon §10 + §32).
   - Insert `field_unmask_grants` row referencing `signature_chains` from the previous step.
   - Emit `compliance:break_glass:grant:invalidate` event on the cache-invalidation bus (canon F025) so subsequent reads pick up the grant immediately.
7. Return `{ grantId, grantedUntil, signatureChainEntryId, auditLogId }`.

`revokeGrant(...)`:
- Manual revoke requires `compliance:break_glass:revoke` permission. Sets `revoked_at + revocation_reason='manual_revoke'`. Writes audit + emits cache-bust.
- A user revoking their own active grant (e.g., "I'm done; don't leave it sitting") is allowed via `compliance:break_glass:revoke_own` (less-privileged code).

**`BreakGlassRevokerService`** — worker side; `apps/worker/src/compliance/break-glass-revoker.service.ts`:
- Scheduled via SchedulingModule every 60 seconds.
- Query: `SELECT id FROM compliance.field_unmask_grants WHERE granted_until <= now() AND revoked_at IS NULL`.
- For each: set `revoked_at = now(), revocation_reason='auto_expired'`; write audit row; emit cache-bust event.
- Self-bound batch size 500 per tick (avoids long transactions).

**`AuthorizationService.evaluateFieldDecision`** — extended (existing service from canon §28):

The three-stage evaluator per §3.10 prose:

```typescript
function evaluateFieldDecision(ctx, property, record): FieldDecision {
  // Stage 1 — Hard-deny classes (overrides everything, including grants)
  if (HARD_DENY_CLASSES.has(property.confidentiality_class)) {
    return { effect: 'deny', matchedLevel: 0, matchedRuleId: 'hard_deny_class', ... };
  }
  // Stage 2 — Active grant short-circuits to UNMASK
  if (property.break_glass_eligible) {
    const grant = ctx.breakGlassGrantCache.get(`${record.id}:${property.id}`);
    if (grant && grant.granted_until > now() && !grant.revoked_at) {
      return { effect: 'allow', matchedLevel: 'break_glass_grant', matchedRuleId: grant.id, ... };
    }
  }
  // Stage 3 — Normal canon §28.5 7-level matrix
  return evaluateNormalFieldDecision(ctx, property, record);
}
```

The grant cache (`UserRequestContext.breakGlassGrantCache`) is request-scoped + populated lazily on first field decision involving an eligible property. Cache-bust events invalidate the entry. The evaluator's `granted_until > now()` check is the fail-safe — even if the auto-revoker is delayed, an expired grant CANNOT unmask because the evaluator sees the past `granted_until` and falls through to stage 3.

| `GET` | `/api/compliance/break-glass/properties` | `@RequirePermission('metadata:property:read')` | query: `collectionId?` — returns eligibility metadata for UI break-glass button rendering |

New permission codes:
- `compliance:break_glass:request`
- `compliance:break_glass:revoke` (revokes any grant; admin)
- `compliance:break_glass:revoke_own` (less-privileged)
- `compliance:break_glass:audit_read` (Compliance Officer forensic query)

#### 13.11.5 Validator extensions

Pack validator gains 3 publish gates:

1. **G11.1** — A property MUST NOT have BOTH `break_glass_eligible=true` AND `confidentiality_class ∈ hard-deny enum`. Error: `BREAK_GLASS_HARD_DENY_CONFLICT` (lists the offending property + its class).
2. **G11.2** — Pack manifest `break_glass.max_duration_seconds` MUST be ≤ 3600 (60 minutes platform cap). Error: `BREAK_GLASS_DURATION_CAP_EXCEEDED`.
3. **G11.3** — Every `reason_codes.applicable_signature_meanings[]` value MUST be a recognized meaning — the enum now includes `'break_glass'` alongside the §13.7.1 five. Error: `INVALID_SIGNATURE_MEANING_TAG` (extends §13.7.7 G7.3).

#### 13.11.6 Service-boundary scanner rules

| Entity | Allowed writers |
|---|---|
| `FieldUnmaskGrant` | `BreakGlassService.requestGrant`, `BreakGlassService.revokeGrant`, `BreakGlassRevokerService.sweep` |

Property column updates to `break_glass_eligible` / `confidentiality_class` go through the existing `PropertyDefinitionService` (already in the metadata-writers list).

#### 13.11.7 Tests (self-test ≥ 14 assertions)

1. **`break-glass-happy-path.spec.ts`** — request grant on eligible property; fresh WebAuthn assertion present; row created; signature chain extended; audit log row written; subsequent record-read returns the unmasked value within `granted_until`.
2. **`break-glass-hard-deny-class-refused.spec.ts`** — property classified `never_reveal`; request grant → `BREAK_GLASS_PROPERTY_INELIGIBLE`; no row created. Repeat for each of the 5 hard-deny classes.
3. **`break-glass-not-eligible.spec.ts`** — property with `break_glass_eligible=false` and `confidentiality_class='sensitive'`; request grant → `BREAK_GLASS_PROPERTY_INELIGIBLE`.
4. **`break-glass-no-row-visibility.spec.ts`** — user lacks row-level read access to record; request grant returns canon §28 minimal 403 (cannot break-glass a row you can't see).
5. **`break-glass-webauthn-required.spec.ts`** — request grant without fresh assertion → 401; with stale (> 60s) assertion → 401.
6. **`break-glass-duration-cap.spec.ts`** — request 3700 seconds; clamped to 3600 (platform cap); response includes `grantedUntil` reflecting clamp.
7. **`break-glass-pack-policy-cap.spec.ts`** — pack with `max_duration_seconds=600` overrides platform default; request 3000 → clamped to 600.
8. **`break-glass-auto-revoke.spec.ts`** — grant with `granted_until = now()+5s`; wait > 5s + scheduler tick; row has `revoked_at, revocation_reason='auto_expired'`; subsequent record read returns masked.
9. **`break-glass-evaluator-failsafe.spec.ts`** — grant expired but auto-revoker hasn't run yet (row's `revoked_at` still NULL); evaluator's `granted_until > now()` check returns `mask` (not unmask). The fail-safe holds without scheduler.
10. **`break-glass-manual-revoke.spec.ts`** — grant created; admin revokes; subsequent reads return masked even before `granted_until`.
11. **`break-glass-revoke-own.spec.ts`** — user with `revoke_own` revokes own grant; user without `revoke_own` cannot revoke someone else's grant.
12. **`break-glass-cache-bust.spec.ts`** — grant insertion emits `compliance:break_glass:grant:invalidate`; concurrent request's cache picks up new grant on next field decision (assert via 2-request sequence + cache hit/miss counter).
13. **`break-glass-forensic-query.spec.ts`** — Compliance Officer with `audit_read` permission queries all grants in date range; CSV export returns every grant including auto-revoke + manual-revoke entries.
14. **`break-glass-property-validator-conflict.spec.ts`** — pack declares property with `break_glass_eligible=true AND confidentiality_class='legal_hold'`; pack publish refused with G11.1 `BREAK_GLASS_HARD_DENY_CONFLICT`.

### 13.12 Worked example: §3.11 External-Collaborator Session Tokens (full artifact-level spec — kiosk + magic-link via canon §29.7 extensions)

#### 13.12.1 Tables

Two new tables in `schema: 'identity'` (adjacent to canon §29.5 refresh_tokens + canon §29.7 service_principals).

**`identity.kiosk_sessions`** — time-bound read-only device-bound sessions for auditors / regulators.

| Column | Type | Default | Nullable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | `uuid` | `gen_random_uuid()` | NOT NULL | PK |
| `instance_id` | `uuid` | — | NULL | Same posture |
| `code` | `varchar(64)` | — | NOT NULL | UNIQUE; public-facing kiosk code (high-entropy) |

| `workspace_id` | `uuid` | — | NOT NULL | FK → `metadata.workspaces(id)`; the bound workspace is the ONLY surface the kiosk can read |
| `bound_device_fingerprint` | `bytea` | — | NOT NULL | 32 bytes; SHA-256 of `(user_agent || screen_dims || tz_offset || nonce)` captured at first bind; subsequent requests must present a matching fingerprint or the session is treated as compromised |
| `display_label` | `text` | — | NULL | UI-friendly label, e.g. "iPad - 5N Wing Audit 2026-05-17"; auditor-facing |
| `granted_by_user_id` | `uuid` | — | NOT NULL | FK → `identity.users(id)`; who handed the auditor the device |
| `granted_at` | `timestamptz` | `now()` | NOT NULL | — |
| `bound_at` | `timestamptz` | — | NULL | When the auditor's device first redeemed the code; NULL = code not yet bound |
| `expires_at` | `timestamptz` | — | NOT NULL | Hard expiry; default `granted_at + 24h`; pack policy may extend up to 7 days |
| `revoked_at` | `timestamptz` | — | NULL | One-tap revoke |
| `revoked_reason` | `varchar(64)` | — | NULL | `auditor_departed` / `compromise_response` / `auto_expired` / `granted_by_revoke` |
| `signing_kid` | `varchar(64)` | — | NOT NULL | Per canon §29.2; per-purpose kid namespace (`kiosk:<purpose>`) |
| `audit_log_id` | `uuid` | — | NOT NULL | UNIQUE; FK |

Indexes: PK; UNIQUE `(code)`; `ix_ks_active ON (workspace_id) WHERE revoked_at IS NULL AND expires_at > now()`; `ix_ks_expiring ON (expires_at) WHERE revoked_at IS NULL`.

**`identity.collaborator_invitations`** — single-use magic-link invitations for external contractors.

| Column | Type | Default | Nullable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | `uuid` | `gen_random_uuid()` | NOT NULL | PK |
| `instance_id` | `uuid` | — | NULL | Same posture |
| `code` | `varchar(64)` | — | NOT NULL | UNIQUE; the magic-link path component |
| `email` | `text` | — | NULL | Required when `delivery_method='email'` |
| `phone` | `varchar(32)` | — | NULL | Required when `delivery_method='sms'` |
| `delivery_method` | `varchar(16)` | — | NOT NULL | CHECK ∈ `{email, sms}` |
| `scope_collection_id` | `uuid` | — | NOT NULL | The collection containing the scoped record |
| `scope_record_id` | `uuid` | — | NOT NULL | The single record the collaborator can interact with |
| `permitted_actions` | `varchar(64)[]` | `'{}'::varchar[]` | NOT NULL | Subset of `{view, attach_photo, attach_document, add_note, sign_closeout}` |
| `granted_by_user_id` | `uuid` | — | NOT NULL | FK |
| `granted_at` | `timestamptz` | `now()` | NOT NULL | — |
| `expires_at` | `timestamptz` | — | NOT NULL | Default `granted_at + 14 days` |
| `consumed_at` | `timestamptz` | — | NULL | Set on first redemption; subsequent attempts return 410 |
| `consumed_session_token_hash` | `bytea` | — | NULL | 32 bytes; SHA-256 of the resulting session JWT for forensic linking |
| `revoked_at` | `timestamptz` | — | NULL | One-tap revoke |
| `revoked_reason` | `varchar(64)` | — | NULL | — |
| `signing_kid` | `varchar(64)` | — | NOT NULL | Per canon §29.2; per-purpose kid namespace (`collaborator:<purpose>`) |
| `audit_log_id` | `uuid` | — | NOT NULL | UNIQUE; FK |

Indexes: PK; UNIQUE `(code)`; `ix_ci_consumable ON (code) WHERE consumed_at IS NULL AND revoked_at IS NULL AND expires_at > now()`; `ix_ci_scope ON (scope_collection_id, scope_record_id)`.

#### 13.12.2 Migrations

| # | Filename | Action |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `1937000000000-create-kiosk-sessions.ts` | Table + indexes |
| 2 | `1937000000001-create-collaborator-invitations.ts` | Table + indexes |

#### 13.12.3 Services

`apps/api/src/app/identity/external/` (new submodule under existing identity module).

**`KioskSessionService`** — `apps/api/src/app/identity/external/kiosk-session.service.ts`:

```typescript
issue(input: IssueKioskRequest, ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<KioskCode>;
bind(code: string, deviceFingerprint: Buffer): Promise<KioskJwt>;
revoke(id: string, reason: string, ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<void>;
list(filter: KioskFilter, ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<KioskSession[]>;
```

`issue(...)`:
1. Authority check: `identity:kiosk:issue` permission.
2. Validate `workspace_id` exists and is readable by the issuer.
3. Compute `expires_at = min(requested_duration, 7 days, pack_policy.max_kiosk_duration)`.
4. Insert `kiosk_sessions` row via `withAudit`; return the generated `code` (high-entropy 32-byte random, base32 of length 64).

`bind(...)`:
- Public endpoint (`@Public()`). Called by the auditor's device on first scan.
- Validates row not expired, not revoked, not yet bound. Single-bind enforced via row-update `WHERE bound_at IS NULL` predicate; concurrent bind attempts → 410 for all but the winner.
- Computes `bound_device_fingerprint` from the request's user-agent + screen dims + tz-offset + a server-generated nonce returned to the client.
- Stamps `bound_at`; mints a KMS-signed JWT (ES256, per canon §29.1) with claims:
  - `aud='kiosk'`
  - `sub='kiosk:<sessionId>'`
  - `instance_id`, `session_id=row.id`, `kid` from `signing_kid`
  - `permitted_actions=['read']`
  - `workspace_id`, `device_fp_hash` (truncated 12-hex-char prefix of fingerprint for in-token verification)
  - `exp = row.expires_at`, fresh `iat`
- Returns `{ jwt, expiresAt }` to the device. The JWT never carries `userId`.

`revoke(...)`:
- Sets `revoked_at + revoked_reason`. The `JwtAuthGuard` rejects subsequent calls because the kiosk session lookup (added below) fails the `revoked_at IS NULL AND expires_at > now()` predicate.

**`JwtAuthGuard`** — gains a `kind: 'kiosk'` branch alongside the existing `user` / `service` branches (canon §29.7 discriminated union):

```typescript
if (decoded.aud === 'kiosk') {
  const session = await kioskSessionRepo.findActive(decoded.session_id);
  if (!session) throw 401;
  // Device fingerprint binding check
  const presentedFp = computeFingerprint(req);
  if (presentedFp.toString('hex').slice(0, 12) !== decoded.device_fp_hash) throw 401;
  req.context = { kind: 'kiosk', sessionId, workspaceId, ... };
}
```

A new helper `assertKioskContext(ctx)` narrows for consumers. The §28 evaluator hard-rejects any write op when `ctx.kind === 'kiosk'` regardless of role — kiosks are read-only by construction, not by policy.

**`CollaboratorInvitationService`** — `apps/api/src/app/identity/external/collaborator-invitation.service.ts`:

```typescript
issue(input: IssueCollaboratorRequest, ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<CollaboratorCode>;
redeem(code: string, deviceFingerprint?: Buffer): Promise<CollaboratorJwt>;
revoke(id: string, reason: string, ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<void>;
```

`issue(...)`: similar to kiosk but for a specific record. Triggers delivery via `NotificationService.deliver({ method, recipient, template: 'collaborator_invitation', payload: { link, expiresAt }})`. Delivery webhook URL is the customer's outbound notifications channel.

`redeem(...)`: single-use; flips `consumed_at` atomically (UPDATE...WHERE consumed_at IS NULL); on win, mints a JWT with `aud='collaborator'`, `permitted_actions=row.permitted_actions`, `scope.collectionId / recordId`, `exp = min(invitation.expires_at, now() + 4h)` (collaborator sessions don't last as long as the invitation window — once redeemed, the working session is bounded to 4 hours).

`JwtAuthGuard` gains a `kind: 'collaborator'` branch:

```typescript
if (decoded.aud === 'collaborator') {
  const inv = await invRepo.findById(decoded.invitation_id);
  if (!inv || inv.revoked_at) throw 401;
  req.context = { kind: 'collaborator', invitationId, scopeCollectionId, scopeRecordId, permittedActions, ... };
}
```

The §28 evaluator: a collaborator context can READ + UPDATE only the bound record AND only fields whose property has `collaborator_writable=true` (proposed new boolean column on `property_definitions` — flagged as founder-correctable below); attempts outside scope → 403 minimal shape.

#### 13.12.4 API endpoints

| Method | Path | Boundary | Body / params |
|---|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/api/identity/kiosk-sessions` | `@RequirePermission('identity:kiosk:issue')` | `{ purpose, workspaceId, displayLabel?, requestedDurationSeconds? }` |
| `POST` | `/api/public/kiosk/:code/bind` | `@Public()` | `{ userAgent, screenDims, tzOffset }` returns `{ jwt, expiresAt }` |
| `DELETE` | `/api/identity/kiosk-sessions/:id` | `@RequirePermission('identity:kiosk:revoke')` | `{ reason }` |
| `GET` | `/api/identity/kiosk-sessions` | `@RequirePermission('identity:kiosk:audit_read')` | query: `workspaceId?`, `active?`, `from?`, `to?` |
| `POST` | `/api/identity/collaborator-invitations` | `@RequirePermission('identity:collaborator:issue')` | `{ scopeCollectionId, scopeRecordId, permittedActions, deliveryMethod, recipientEmail?, recipientPhone? }` |
| `POST` | `/api/public/collaborator/:code/redeem` | `@Public()` | `{}` returns `{ jwt, expiresAt }` |
| `DELETE` | `/api/identity/collaborator-invitations/:id` | `@RequirePermission('identity:collaborator:revoke')` | `{ reason }` |

New permission codes (registered in `PERMISSION_REGISTRY`):
- `identity:kiosk:issue`, `identity:kiosk:revoke`, `identity:kiosk:audit_read`
- `identity:collaborator:issue`, `identity:collaborator:revoke`

PUBLIC_ALLOWLIST entries added for the two `/api/public/` bind/redeem endpoints.

#### 13.12.5 Validator extensions

Pack validator gains 3 publish gates:

1. **G12.1** — Pack `kiosk_sessions.purposes[]` MUST declare a `purpose` value AND a `signing_kid_namespace` matching the `kiosk:<purpose>` pattern. Error: `INVALID_KIOSK_PURPOSE_DECLARATION`.
2. **G12.2** — Pack `collaborator_invitations.permitted_actions[]` MUST be a subset of `{view, attach_photo, attach_document, add_note, sign_closeout}`. Error: `INVALID_COLLABORATOR_ACTION`.
3. **G12.3** — When `collaborator_invitations.permitted_actions` includes `sign_closeout`, the bound collection MUST have at least one reason_code seeded by THIS pack with `applicable_signature_meanings ∋ 'closure'`. Error: `COLLABORATOR_CLOSEOUT_MISSING_REASON_CODE`.

#### 13.12.6 Service-boundary scanner rules

| Entity | Allowed writers |
|---|---|
| `KioskSession` | `KioskSessionService.*` |
| `CollaboratorInvitation` | `CollaboratorInvitationService.*` |

Adds branches to `JwtAuthGuard` for `kiosk` + `collaborator` audiences; the no-untyped-req scanner (canon §29.6) requires new helpers `assertKioskContext` / `assertCollaboratorContext`.

#### 13.12.7 Tests (self-test ≥ 14 assertions)

1. **`kiosk-issue-and-bind.spec.ts`** — issue code; bind from device A; JWT minted with correct claims; second-device bind on same code → 410.
2. **`kiosk-fingerprint-tampering.spec.ts`** — bind device A; replay JWT with mismatched user-agent → 401.
3. **`kiosk-expired-bind.spec.ts`** — issue code with `expires_at = past`; bind → 410.
4. **`kiosk-readonly-enforced.spec.ts`** — kiosk JWT attempting POST to any data endpoint → §28 evaluator rejects with canon §28 minimal 403; AccessAuditPort.logAccessDenied row written.
5. **`kiosk-workspace-bound.spec.ts`** — kiosk bound to workspace W1; attempts to read from workspace W2 → 403.
6. **`kiosk-revoke.spec.ts`** — issue + bind + revoke; subsequent JWT presentation → 401.
7. **`kiosk-auto-expire.spec.ts`** — bound kiosk past `expires_at`; JWT verification fails on `exp` check; AND the JwtAuthGuard's session lookup also fails (defense-in-depth — even if `exp` was tampered, the DB row's expiry is checked).
8. **`collaborator-issue-deliver.spec.ts`** — issue invitation with `delivery_method='email'`; `NotificationService.deliver` called with the magic-link URL.
9. **`collaborator-redeem-once.spec.ts`** — redeem succeeds + mints JWT; second redeem → 410.
10. **`collaborator-scope-bound.spec.ts`** — JWT scoped to record R1; attempts to read R2 in same collection → 403.
11. **`collaborator-action-bound.spec.ts`** — invitation with `permitted_actions=['view', 'attach_photo']`; attempt `add_note` → 403; attempt `view` + `attach_photo` → succeeds.
12. **`collaborator-sign-closeout.spec.ts`** — invitation with `sign_closeout`; collaborator signs; `electronic_signatures` row written with `signer_user_id` resolved to a system-generated collaborator-principal user (canon §29.7 service-principal-style binding); chain extended.
13. **`collaborator-validator-closeout-without-reason.spec.ts`** — pack declares `permitted_actions ∋ sign_closeout` but no reason_code; publish refused with G12.3.
14. **`external-session-context-narrowing.spec.ts`** — controller uses `req.context` directly without `assertKioskContext` or `assertCollaboratorContext` → no-untyped-req scanner fails CI.

### 13.13 Worked example: §3.12 Storage & Evidence Attachment Runtime (full artifact-level spec — generic pre-signed upload + AV/secret/PII scan + object-lock + retention)

#### 13.13.1 Tables

Two new tables in `schema: 'storage'` (NEW schema). Shared substrate consumed by §3.6 evidence_artifacts, §3.9 intake attachments, and every pack that handles file uploads.

#### 13.13.3 Services

`apps/api/src/app/storage/` (new API module) + `apps/worker/src/storage/` (new worker module).

**`StoragePresignService`** — `apps/api/src/app/storage/presign.service.ts`:

```typescript
requestUpload(input: PresignRequest, ctx: RequestContext): Promise<PresignResult>;
```

`PresignRequest` carries `{ purpose, scopeCollectionId?, scopeRecordId?, expectedSizeBytes?, contentType }`. Flow:
1. Resolve purpose policy from a config registry (purpose-to-(retention_class, max_size_bytes, allowed_content_types) mapping declared by packs).
2. Validate `expectedSizeBytes ≤ purpose.max_size_bytes` and `contentType ∈ purpose.allowed_content_types`.
3. Authorization: callers must hold `storage:upload:request` permission OR be one of the trusted principal kinds (intake processor, collaborator session). The request_context's `kind` drives this check.
4. Generate `s3_object_key`, mint a 15-minute presigned PUT URL via S3 SDK, write `attachment_uploads` row via `withAudit` with `status='presigned'`.
5. Return `{ uploadId, presignedUrl, expiresAt, objectKey }`.

**`AttachmentIngestProcessor`** — worker side; triggered by S3 event notification (`s3:ObjectCreated:Put`):
1. Look up `attachment_uploads` row by `s3_object_key`; if not found OR `status != 'presigned'` → emit RuntimeAnomaly (`storage_ingest_unexpected_object`) and quarantine.
2. Verify `actual_size_bytes ≤ purpose.max_size_bytes`; mismatch → `quarantined`.
3. Sniff magic bytes; if `actual_content_type` mismatches declared → `quarantined`.
4. Compute SHA-256 → `content_hash_sha256`.
5. Set `status='scanning'`, `uploaded_at=now()`. Enqueue per-scanner jobs.

**`AvScanProcessor`** — ClamAV (or pluggable); writes `attachment_scan_results` row with `scan_kind='av'`.
**`SecretScanProcessor`** — gitleaks-rules-based; writes row with `scan_kind='secret'`.
**`PiiScanProcessor`** — Presidio or equivalent; writes row with `scan_kind='pii'`.

Each scanner's verdict feeds into a state-machine check:
- ALL `verdict='clean'` → `status='clean'`; trigger link-on-clean.
- ANY `verdict='dirty'` → `status='quarantined'`; `quarantine_reason=<details>`; emit RuntimeAnomaly.
- ANY `verdict='suspicious'` → quarantine + emit RuntimeAnomaly; secret/PII findings always treated as quarantine (deliberately strict).
- ANY `verdict='error'` AND no other dirty → retry the failed scan once; second error → quarantine with reason `scan_error_retry_exhausted`.

**`LinkOnCleanProcessor`** — runs when ALL configured scans for the purpose return `clean`:
1. Compute `retention_until` from `purpose.retention_class` (uses the §13.7 classes — `part_11_clinical`, `osha`, etc.).
2. Apply S3 `PutObjectRetention` with `ObjectLockRetainUntilDate=retention_until` and `Mode='COMPLIANCE'` (per §3.6 founder default).
3. Resolve `purpose.link_target` and INSERT the artifact row into the target table (`compliance.evidence_artifacts` for evidence purposes; `intake.public_intake_attachments` already exists from §13.10 — the link-on-clean stamps `scan_status='clean'` rather than inserting a new row).
4. Update `attachment_uploads` row: `status='linked'`, `linked_artifact_table`, `linked_artifact_id`, `linked_at`.

**`ExpiredPresignSweeper`** — worker; scheduled every 5 minutes:
- Finds rows where `status='presigned'` AND `presigned_url_expires_at < now() - INTERVAL '1 hour'`. Marks them `status='expired'` so they don't accumulate.

#### 13.13.4 API endpoints

| Method | Path | Boundary | Body / params |
|---|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/api/storage/uploads` | `@AuthenticatedOnly()` (per-purpose authorization inside service) | `{ purpose, scopeCollectionId?, scopeRecordId?, expectedSizeBytes?, contentType }` returns `{ uploadId, presignedUrl, expiresAt }` |
| `GET` | `/api/storage/uploads/:id` | `@RequirePermission('storage:upload:read')` | — returns status + scan results |
| `GET` | `/api/storage/uploads/:id/download-url` | `@RequireCollectionAccess('read')` (resolved via `scope_collection_id`/`scope_record_id`) | — returns a 60-second signed GET URL when `status='linked'` |

New permission code: `storage:upload:read`. The `requestUpload` controller is `@AuthenticatedOnly()` because purpose-specific authorization is too dynamic for a single boundary decorator — the service computes it from purpose policy + principal kind.

#### 13.13.5 Validator extensions

Pack validator gains 3 publish gates:

1. **G13.1** — Pack `storage.purposes[]` MUST declare `(name, retention_class, max_size_bytes, allowed_content_types[], link_target_table)`. Error: `MISSING_STORAGE_PURPOSE_DECLARATION`.
2. **G13.2** — `retention_class` MUST be in the §13.7 canonical enum. Error: `INVALID_RETENTION_CLASS`.
3. **G13.3** — `link_target_table` MUST be one of the registered receivers: `compliance.evidence_artifacts`, `intake.public_intake_attachments`, or a pack-declared table whose schema includes the required columns (sha256, content_type, size_bytes, s3_object_version_id). Error: `INVALID_LINK_TARGET`.

#### 13.13.6 Service-boundary scanner rules

| Entity | Allowed writers |
|---|---|
| `AttachmentUpload` | `StoragePresignService.requestUpload`, `AttachmentIngestProcessor.process`, `LinkOnCleanProcessor.link`, `ExpiredPresignSweeper.sweep` |
| `AttachmentScanResult` | `AvScanProcessor`, `SecretScanProcessor`, `PiiScanProcessor`, `AttachmentIngestProcessor` (for content_type results) |

Pack consumers MUST call `StoragePresignService.requestUpload(...)` for uploads; direct `storage.*` writes from packs fail the scanner.

#### 13.13.7 Tests (self-test ≥ 12 assertions)

1. **`storage-presign-happy-path.spec.ts`** — request upload; receive presigned URL; PUT to LocalStack S3; ingest worker fires; SHA-256 computed; scans clean; link-on-clean inserts into `compliance.evidence_artifacts`; status `linked`.
2. **`storage-presign-expired-url.spec.ts`** — wait 16 minutes; attempt PUT → S3 rejects; ExpiredPresignSweeper marks row `expired`.
3. **`storage-size-cap.spec.ts`** — request 30MB upload for a purpose with `max_size_bytes=25MB` → `BAD_REQUEST` at presign; PUT of oversize file rejected by ingest worker → `quarantined`.
4. **`storage-content-type-mismatch.spec.ts`** — declare `application/pdf`; upload a PNG; magic-byte sniff detects mismatch; `quarantined` with reason `content_type_mismatch`.
5. **`storage-av-dirty.spec.ts`** — ClamAV verdict `dirty`; row `quarantined`; RuntimeAnomaly emitted.
6. **`storage-secret-dirty.spec.ts`** — upload contains an AWS access key string; secret scanner flags; `quarantined`; RuntimeAnomaly.
7. **`storage-pii-suspicious.spec.ts`** — upload contains PII (SSN-shaped); Presidio flags `suspicious`; `quarantined` (suspicious is treated as quarantine).
8. **`storage-scan-error-retry.spec.ts`** — AV scanner crashes once; scan retried; second attempt clean; row proceeds to `linked`.
9. **`storage-scan-error-exhausted.spec.ts`** — AV scanner crashes twice; row `quarantined` with reason `scan_error_retry_exhausted`.
10. **`storage-link-on-clean-target-routing.spec.ts`** — purpose `intake_attachment` routes to `intake.public_intake_attachments`; purpose `evidence_attachment` routes to `compliance.evidence_artifacts`. Mistaken target → G13.3 validator refusal at pack-publish time.
11. **`storage-download-authz.spec.ts`** — linked artifact; user without `@RequireCollectionAccess('read')` on the scope record → 403; with access → 60s signed URL.
12. **`storage-service-boundary-scanner.spec.ts`** — adding a `attachmentUploadsRepo.save()` call from outside the allowed-writers list fails the scanner.

### 13.14 Worked example: §3.13 Connector Runtime + Certified Simulators (full artifact-level spec — IntegrationAdapter SDK + fixture-replay conformance)

#### 13.14.1 Tables

Two new tables in `schema: 'integrations'` (NEW schema).

**`integrations.integration_adapter_registry`** — per-instance enabled adapters.

| Column | Type | Default | Nullable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | `uuid` | `gen_random_uuid()` | NOT NULL | PK |
| `instance_id` | `uuid` | — | NULL | Same posture |

| `adapter_version` | `varchar(32)` | — | NOT NULL | Semver; the registered build |
| `mode` | `varchar(16)` | — | NOT NULL | CHECK ∈ `{live, simulator}`; live = real integration; simulator = certified simulator stub |
| `config_handle` | `text` | — | NOT NULL | Opaque reference into `integrations.integration_secret` (§3.18); never the secret value |
| `conformance_declaration` | `jsonb` | — | NOT NULL | `{ operations: [{op_id, version}], fixture_set_id, hash_of_fixtures }` |
| `last_health_check_at` | `timestamptz` | — | NULL | Stamped by `AdapterHealthCheckProcessor` |
| `last_health_check_verdict` | `varchar(16)` | — | NULL | `ok` / `degraded` / `down` |
| `enabled` | `boolean` | `true` | NOT NULL | Operator can disable without uninstalling |
| `installed_at` | `timestamptz` | `now()` | NOT NULL | — |
| `installed_by_user_id` | `uuid` | — | NOT NULL | FK |
| `audit_log_id` | `uuid` | — | NOT NULL | UNIQUE; FK |

Indexes: PK; UNIQUE `(instance_id, adapter_id)`; `ix_iar_health ON (last_health_check_verdict, last_health_check_at) WHERE enabled = true`.

**`integrations.adapter_conformance_records`** — per-replay run pass/fail history.

| Column | Type | Default | Nullable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | `uuid` | `gen_random_uuid()` | NOT NULL | PK |
| `adapter_registry_id` | `uuid` | — | NOT NULL | FK → `integration_adapter_registry(id)` |
| `fixture_set_id` | `varchar(120)` | — | NOT NULL | E.g. `hl7v2-adt-fixtures-v3`; canonical fixture bundle identifier |
| `fixture_count` | `int` | — | NOT NULL | Number of fixtures in the bundle |
| `passed_count` | `int` | — | NOT NULL | — |
| `failed_count` | `int` | — | NOT NULL | — |
| `results` | `jsonb` | — | NOT NULL | Per-fixture: `[{fixture_id, op_id, expected_hash, actual_hash, verdict}]` |

| `audit_log_id` | `uuid` | — | NOT NULL | UNIQUE; FK |

Indexes: PK; `ix_acr_adapter ON (adapter_registry_id, replay_finished_at DESC)`; `ix_acr_gate ON (gate_acceptance_run, replay_finished_at DESC) WHERE gate_acceptance_run = true`.

| 3 | `1939000000002-create-adapter-conformance-records.ts` | Table + indexes |

#### 13.14.3 Adapter SDK contract

`libs/integration-adapter-sdk` (new package) exports:

```typescript
export interface IntegrationAdapter<TConfig, TPayload, TResult> {
  readonly adapterId: string;            // e.g. 'hl7v2'
  readonly adapterVersion: string;       // semver
  readonly mode: 'live' | 'simulator';
  readonly conformance: ConformanceDeclaration;

  init(secretHandle: string, config: TConfig): Promise<void>;
  healthCheck(): Promise<{ verdict: 'ok' | 'degraded' | 'down'; details?: Record<string, unknown> }>;
  executeOperation(opId: string, payload: TPayload): Promise<TResult>;
  shutdown(): Promise<void>;
}

export interface ConformanceDeclaration {
  fixtureSetId: string;
  operations: Array<{ opId: string; version: string }>;
  fixturesPath: string;  // relative to adapter package root
}
```

Every adapter ships in **two flavors**: a `<adapterId>-live` and `<adapterId>-simulator` package; both implement the same interface. The simulator's `conformance.fixtureSetId` declares which fixture bundle it conforms to.

Fixture bundle format: `<adapter>/fixtures/<fixtureSetId>/<opId>/{request.json,expected_response.json}`. Bundle hash (SHA-256 of canonical bytes) stored in `conformance_declaration.hash_of_fixtures` so drift is detectable.

#### 13.14.4 Services

`apps/api/src/app/integrations/` (new module) + `apps/worker/src/integrations/` (new module).

**`AdapterRegistryService`** — `apps/api/src/app/integrations/adapter-registry.service.ts`:

```typescript
register(input: RegisterAdapterRequest, ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<AdapterRegistry>;
setMode(adapterId: string, mode: 'live' | 'simulator', ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<void>;
enable(adapterId: string, ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<void>;
disable(adapterId: string, reason: string, ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<void>;
list(filter: RegistryFilter, ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<AdapterRegistry[]>;
```

`register(...)` flow:
1. Authority: `integrations:adapter:install` permission (admin / Compliance Officer).
2. Validate the requested `(adapterId, adapterVersion, mode)` matches a package available in the deployment's adapter manifest (a build-time-frozen list of supported adapters per release).
3. Run an immediate conformance replay (PR-2 acceptance) — refuse registration if `failed_count > 0`.
4. Initialize adapter via `adapter.init(secretHandle, config)`; refuse with structured error if `init` throws.
5. Insert `integration_adapter_registry` row via `withAudit`; first health check fires immediately.

`setMode(...)` switches an adapter between live and simulator. Switching is a significant operational event — emits high-severity audit row + page-on-call notification.

**`ConformanceReplayService`** — runs the fixture replay loop:
```typescript
replay(adapterRegistryId: string, gateAcceptance: boolean, ctx: RequestContext): Promise<ConformanceRecord>;
```
1. Loads fixtures from `adapter.conformance.fixturesPath`.
2. Verifies bundle hash matches `conformance_declaration.hash_of_fixtures`; mismatch → fixture-tampering error.
3. For each fixture: calls `adapter.executeOperation(opId, request)` and compares the canonical hash of the response to `expected_response`'s canonical hash.
4. Writes `adapter_conformance_records` row with full results.
5. When `gateAcceptance=true`, the row is marked immutable (any UPDATE attempt fails via row-level trigger).

**`AdapterHealthCheckProcessor`** — worker; scheduled every 60 seconds for each enabled adapter:
1. Calls `adapter.healthCheck()` with a 5-second timeout.
2. Updates `last_health_check_at` + `last_health_check_verdict`.
3. Verdict transition `ok → degraded/down` emits RuntimeAnomaly.

**`AdapterCallExecutor`** — the call surface every pack-side integration code uses:
```typescript
execute(adapterId: string, opId: string, payload: unknown): Promise<unknown>;
```
1. Resolves adapter from registry; refuses with 503 if `enabled=false` OR `last_health_check_verdict='down'`.
2. Looks up the adapter's killswitch state (§3.18 link): if killed, refuses fail-closed.
3. Logs the call (request shape, NOT raw secret) to `integrations.outbound_call_log` (§3.18 table).
4. Calls `adapter.executeOperation(opId, payload)`.
5. Returns result OR re-throws.

- `integrations:adapter:uninstall` (`dangerous: true`)
- `integrations:adapter:read`
- `integrations:adapter:replay`

#### 13.14.6 Validator extensions

Pack validator gains 3 publish gates:

1. **G14.1** — Pack manifest `integrations[]` MUST declare required `adapter_id` + `minimum_conformance_version`. Error: `MISSING_ADAPTER_DEPENDENCY`.
2. **G14.2** — At install time, each declared adapter MUST have a registered row with `enabled=true` AND `conformance_declaration.fixture_set_id` ≥ pack's `minimum_conformance_version`. Error: `ADAPTER_NOT_AVAILABLE` (install-time, not publish-time).
3. **G14.3** — Pack code-path calls to `AdapterCallExecutor.execute(adapterId, ...)` MUST use only `adapterId` values declared in the pack's `integrations[]`. Error: `UNDECLARED_ADAPTER_USAGE` (catches packs that try to use platform-shared adapters they didn't declare).

#### 13.14.7 Service-boundary scanner rules

| Entity | Allowed writers |
|---|---|
| `AdapterRegistry` | `AdapterRegistryService.*`, `AdapterHealthCheckProcessor.updateHealth` |
| `ConformanceRecord` | `ConformanceReplayService.replay` |

Additionally: `tools/integration-call-check.ts` (NEW scanner) — grep pack code for direct adapter package imports; require all integration calls to flow through `AdapterCallExecutor.execute`. Direct import of an adapter package outside `apps/api/src/app/integrations/**` fails CI.

#### 13.14.8 Tests (self-test ≥ 12 assertions)

1. **`adapter-register-with-conformance.spec.ts`** — register `hl7v2-simulator`; conformance replay passes all fixtures; row created with healthy verdict.
2. **`adapter-register-conformance-fail.spec.ts`** — register with broken fixture set (one expected_response edited); replay fails; registration refused; no row created.
3. **`adapter-fixture-hash-tamper.spec.ts`** — fixture bundle hash on disk does NOT match `conformance_declaration.hash_of_fixtures`; replay refuses with `FIXTURE_BUNDLE_TAMPERED`.
4. **`adapter-set-mode-live-to-sim.spec.ts`** — switch mode live→simulator; high-severity audit row written; subsequent calls go through simulator.
5. **`adapter-health-check-degraded.spec.ts`** — simulator returns `verdict='degraded'`; health check stamps row; RuntimeAnomaly emitted on first degraded transition.
6. **`adapter-call-routed.spec.ts`** — `AdapterCallExecutor.execute('hl7v2', 'ADT-A08', payload)` → call routed to active adapter; result returned; `outbound_call_log` row written.
7. **`adapter-killswitch-fail-closed.spec.ts`** — flip §3.18 killswitch; subsequent `execute()` calls refuse with 503; no adapter code invoked.
8. **`adapter-down-fail-closed.spec.ts`** — adapter health `down`; `execute()` refuses fail-closed.
9. **`adapter-pack-undeclared-usage.spec.ts`** — pack calls `execute('hl7v2', ...)` without declaring `hl7v2` in its manifest; scanner G14.3 fails CI.
10. **`adapter-pack-install-missing-adapter.spec.ts`** — pack with `integrations: [{adapter_id: 'hl7v2', minimum_conformance_version: 'v3'}]`; instance has no `hl7v2` registered; pack install refused.
11. **`adapter-gate-acceptance-immutable.spec.ts`** — conformance record with `gate_acceptance_run=true` cannot be modified; UPDATE attempt fails via trigger.
12. **`adapter-direct-import-scanner.spec.ts`** — pack code imports `@hubblewave/hl7v2-live` directly (bypassing AdapterCallExecutor); scanner fails CI.

### 13.15 Worked example: §3.14 Semantic Search / Vector Match Primitive (full artifact-level spec — pgvector index + explainable confidence bands)

#### 13.15.1 Tables

Two new tables in `schema: 'search'` (existing schema from canon §40 / Plan Fix 30 search authz wave).

**`search.vector_index_entry`** — one row per indexed field-value, partitioned by `collection_id` then by `embedding_model_version`. Reuses canon §28 search-authz pre-filter mechanism (Plan Fix 30 PR-2 + PR-3).

| Column | Type | Default | Nullable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | `uuid` | `gen_random_uuid()` | NOT NULL | PK component (with `collection_id` for partitioning) |
| `instance_id` | `uuid` | — | NULL | Same posture |
| `collection_id` | `uuid` | — | NOT NULL | LIST partition key |
| `record_id` | `uuid` | — | NOT NULL | The indexed record |
| `source_field` | `varchar(120)` | — | NOT NULL | Property `code` whose text was embedded |
| `source_text` | `text` | — | NOT NULL | The exact text embedded (subject to PII redaction policy at pack manifest) |
| `embedding` | `vector(1536)` | — | NOT NULL | pgvector — 1536 dims matches OpenAI text-embedding-3-small AND Ollama nomic-embed-text; founder-correctable in registry |
| `embedding_model_version` | `varchar(64)` | — | NOT NULL | E.g. `openai-3-small-2024-02`, `ollama-nomic-embed-text-v1.5`; SUB-partition key |
| `last_indexed_at` | `timestamptz` | — | NOT NULL | When this entry was last refreshed |
| `provenance` | `jsonb` | `'{}'::jsonb` | NOT NULL | `{ source_kind: 'record_update' \| 'pack_install' \| 'manual_reindex', triggered_by_user_id?, prior_embedding_age_seconds? }` |
| `_collection_id` | `uuid` | — | NOT NULL | Plan Fix 30 PR-3 ACL projection column; mirror of `collection_id` for authz filter |
| `_attribute_*` | `jsonb` | — | NULL | Plan Fix 30 PR-3 ABAC projection columns added per pack's `acl_attributes[]` declaration |
| `created_at` | `timestamptz` | `now()` | NOT NULL | — |

**Partitioning:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE search.vector_index_entry (...) PARTITION BY LIST (collection_id);
-- Per-collection partition, then SUB-partition by embedding_model_version:
CREATE TABLE search.vector_index_entry_{collection_uuid}
  PARTITION OF search.vector_index_entry FOR VALUES IN ('{collection_uuid}')
  PARTITION BY LIST (embedding_model_version);
```

Indexes (per leaf partition):
- PK on `(id, collection_id, embedding_model_version)` — composite required by 2-level partitioning
- IVFFlat or HNSW on `(embedding)` — chosen per leaf based on row count (HNSW preferred when partition > 100k rows; IVFFlat for smaller). `vector_cosine_ops` operator class.
- `ix_vie_record ON (record_id)` for "re-index this record" queries.
- BRIN on `(last_indexed_at)` for retention sweep.

**`search.embedding_model_registry`** — which model is active per (instance, family).

| Column | Type | Default | Nullable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | `uuid` | `gen_random_uuid()` | NOT NULL | PK |
| `instance_id` | `uuid` | — | NULL | Same posture |
| `model_family` | `varchar(64)` | — | NOT NULL | `text` / `image` / `audio`; only `text` shipped at G0a |
| `model_version` | `varchar(64)` | — | NOT NULL | E.g. `openai-3-small-2024-02` |
| `provider` | `varchar(32)` | — | NOT NULL | `openai` / `anthropic` / `ollama` / `bedrock` / `local-onnx` |
| `dimensions` | `int` | — | NOT NULL | E.g. 1536; CHECK `dimensions IN (768, 1024, 1536, 3072)` (covering known production models) |
| `cost_per_million_tokens_usd` | `decimal(10, 4)` | `0` | NOT NULL | Operational telemetry |
| `is_active` | `boolean` | `false` | NOT NULL | Exactly one row per `(instance_id, model_family)` may be active (UNIQUE partial index enforces) |
| `activated_at` | `timestamptz` | — | NULL | Set when `is_active` flipped true |
| `retiring_at` | `timestamptz` | — | NULL | Set when a successor is activated; old partitions retained until cutover sweep completes |
| `audit_log_id` | `uuid` | — | NOT NULL | UNIQUE; FK |
| `created_at` | `timestamptz` | `now()` | NOT NULL | — |

Indexes: PK; UNIQUE `(instance_id, model_family) WHERE is_active = true` — partial uniqueness enforces single-active-model invariant; `ix_emr_family ON (model_family)`.

**Additive column on `metadata.property_definitions`**:

| Column | Type | Default | Nullable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `vector_indexed` | `boolean` | `false` | NOT NULL | When `true`, writes to records of this property trigger embedding generation + index upsert |

#### 13.15.2 Migrations

| # | Filename | Action |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `1940000000000-add-vector-indexed-property-column.ts` | `ALTER TABLE metadata.property_definitions ADD COLUMN vector_indexed boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false;` |
| 2 | `1940000000001-create-embedding-model-registry.ts` | Table + partial unique index |
| 3 | `1940000000002-create-vector-index-entry-parent.ts` | Parent partitioned table (LIST by collection_id) — no leaf partitions yet; subsequent migrations create them on `sync_to_mobile`-style triggers |
| 4 | `1940000000003-seed-default-embedding-model.ts` | Seed `model_family='text'`, `provider='ollama'`, `model_version='nomic-embed-text-v1.5'`, `dimensions=768`, `is_active=true` for dev; production deployments override via control-plane provisioning |

(Founder-correctable: `dimensions=1536` is the platform default for new installs because OpenAI 3-small is the most common production model; Ollama nomic-embed produces 768; an instance can run either by registering the appropriate `embedding_model_registry` row. The `embedding vector(1536)` column declaration locks any single instance to ONE dimension count — switching dimensions requires a partition-reindex migration. The seed flips to 768 dim for dev — flagged in PR-4 acceptance.)

#### 13.15.3 Services

`apps/worker/src/search/embedding-pipeline.processor.ts` + `apps/api/src/app/search/vector/`:

**`EmbeddingPipelineProcessor`** — worker; listens on a Redis stream for `record.modified` + `record.created` events emitted by data services:
1. For each event, iterate over the record's properties; collect those whose `property_definition.vector_indexed = true`.
2. For each such property, generate canonical text (NFC-normalized, whitespace-collapsed); skip if text unchanged from prior embedding (compare via `source_text` field).
3. Invoke the active embedding model (resolved from `embedding_model_registry` for the instance + `model_family='text'`); receive a `vector(N)` where N matches the registered `dimensions`.
4. UPSERT into `search.vector_index_entry` (`record_id, source_field, embedding_model_version` is the upsert key); stamp `provenance.source_kind='record_update'`.
5. Reuse Plan Fix 30 PR-3 ACL projection columns — populate `_collection_id` and `_attribute_*` so subsequent searches respect §28.

**`VectorMatchService`** — `apps/api/src/app/search/vector/vector-match.service.ts`:

```typescript
semanticMatch(query: string, collectionId: string, options: SemanticMatchOptions, ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<RankedMatch[]>;
```

Flow:
1. Resolve active embedding model from registry; refuse with 503 if no active model.
2. Embed the query text (one API call to the active provider).
3. Build the §28 authz pre-filter via `compileSearchAuthz(collectionId, ctx)` (Plan Fix 30 PR-3). The resulting AST translates into a parameterized WHERE clause on `_collection_id` + `_attribute_*` columns.
4. Execute pgvector ANN query: `SELECT id, record_id, source_field, source_text, embedding <=> $1 AS distance FROM search.vector_index_entry WHERE <authz_where> ORDER BY embedding <=> $1 LIMIT $topK;`
5. Compute `confidence = 1 - cosine_distance`. Apply bands: `high ≥ 0.85`; `medium 0.70-0.85`; `low < 0.70`.
6. For low-confidence (< 0.70), AUTOMATICALLY append a lexical fallback (`SearchService.searchLexical` via §28 Typesense path); merge results with `match_kind='lexical_fallback'` flag.
7. Return `RankedMatch[]` with `{ recordId, score, confidence, band, sourceField, sourceText, matchKind: 'vector' | 'lexical_fallback', explainability: { ...explainable_factors } }`.

`explainable_factors`: `{ embedding_model_version, query_token_count, top_neighbor_distance, second_neighbor_distance, lexical_fallback_terms?: string[] }`. The platform surfaces these in the AVA chat trace + `/api/search/explain` endpoint.

**`EmbeddingModelLifecycleService`** — admin path to register, activate, and retire embedding models:
```typescript
register(input: RegisterModelRequest, ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<EmbeddingModelRegistry>;
activate(modelId: string, ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<void>;
reindex(collectionId: string, modelVersion: string, ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<{ jobId: string }>;
```

Switching active model triggers a full background reindex per collection (writes to a new model-version SUB-partition; old SUB-partition retained until cutover sweep removes it 30 days later).

#### 13.15.4 API endpoints

| Method | Path | Boundary | Body / params |
|---|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/api/search/vector` | `@RequireCollectionAccess('read')` | `{ query, collectionId, topK?, options? }` returns ranked matches |

#### 13.15.5 Validator extensions

Pack validator gains 2 publish gates:

1. **G15.1** — Property declared with `vector_indexed=true` MUST be a text-type property (string / text / markdown / longtext). Error: `VECTOR_INDEX_REQUIRES_TEXT_PROPERTY`.
2. **G15.2** — Pack `semantic_search.indexes[]` declarations MUST reference existing properties with `vector_indexed=true`. Error: `SEMANTIC_INDEX_REFERENCES_NON_INDEXED_PROPERTY`.

#### 13.15.7 Tests (self-test ≥ 11 assertions)

1. **`vector-record-modified-triggers-embed.spec.ts`** — record write on a `vector_indexed=true` property → embed-and-upsert row in `vector_index_entry`; `provenance.source_kind='record_update'`.
2. **`vector-text-unchanged-skip.spec.ts`** — second write with same canonical text → no new embedding call (assert via mock counter).
3. **`vector-semantic-match-high-confidence.spec.ts`** — query that closely matches an indexed phrase; returns `band='high'`; `match_kind='vector'`.
4. **`vector-semantic-match-low-confidence-falls-back.spec.ts`** — query with no close match; `band='low'`; lexical fallback fires; merged result includes `match_kind='lexical_fallback'`.
5. **`vector-authz-prefilter.spec.ts`** — user with §28 collection access restricted to status='active' records; vector search returns ONLY active records; status='draft' records absent from result.
6. **`vector-attribute-prefilter.spec.ts`** — user with ABAC `region=NA` rule; results filtered via `_attribute_*` ACL columns.
7. **`vector-explainability.spec.ts`** — every result carries `embedding_model_version` + neighbor distances; `/api/search/explain` returns full audit trail.
8. **`vector-active-model-activate-reindex.spec.ts`** — register new model + activate; full reindex job runs; new SUB-partition populated; old SUB-partition retained 30 days then swept.
9. **`vector-no-active-model.spec.ts`** — instance with NO active model; `semanticMatch` returns 503 with `NO_ACTIVE_EMBEDDING_MODEL`.
10. **`vector-validator-non-text-property.spec.ts`** — pack declares `vector_indexed=true` on a `number` property; publish refused with G15.1.
11. **`vector-validator-undeclared-property.spec.ts`** — pack `semantic_search.indexes[]` references a property not marked `vector_indexed=true`; G15.2 refusal.

### 13.16 Worked example: §3.15 Spatial + Relationship Graph Primitive (full artifact-level spec — generic edges + traversal + route-solve + blast-radius)

#### 13.16.1 Tables

Two new tables in `schema: 'graph'` (NEW schema).

**`graph.relationship_edge`** — every edge in the platform's relationship graph, partitioned by `edge_kind` (LIST).

| Column | Type | Default | Nullable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | `uuid` | `gen_random_uuid()` | NOT NULL | PK component (with `edge_kind`) |
| `instance_id` | `uuid` | — | NULL | Same posture |
| `edge_kind` | `varchar(64)` | — | NOT NULL | LIST partition key; e.g. `floor_connects_to`, `asset_depends_on`, `room_contains_asset`, `corridor_links_rooms`, `key_owned_by`, `circuit_protects` |
| `src_collection_id` | `uuid` | — | NOT NULL | Source node's collection |
| `src_record_id` | `uuid` | — | NOT NULL | Source node |
| `dst_collection_id` | `uuid` | — | NOT NULL | Target node's collection |
| `dst_record_id` | `uuid` | — | NOT NULL | Target node |
| `weight` | `double precision` | `1.0` | NOT NULL | Edge weight (distance / cost / dependency strength) |
| `directed` | `boolean` | `true` | NOT NULL | When `false`, edge is treated as bidirectional in traversal |
| `metadata` | `jsonb` | `'{}'::jsonb` | NOT NULL | Pack-defined edge properties (e.g. `door_locked_after_hours`, `corridor_width_meters`) |
| `valid_from` | `timestamptz` | `now()` | NOT NULL | Edge effective-from (for time-windowed graphs like roster history) |
| `valid_until` | `timestamptz` | — | NULL | NULL = currently valid; non-NULL = retired edge retained for historical traversal |
| `created_at` | `timestamptz` | `now()` | NOT NULL | — |
| `audit_log_id` | `uuid` | — | NOT NULL | UNIQUE; FK |

**Partitioning:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE graph.relationship_edge (...) PARTITION BY LIST (edge_kind);
-- Per-edge-kind partitions are created on first use via DDL migration.
```

Indexes (per partition):
- PK on `(id, edge_kind)`.
- `ix_re_src ON (src_collection_id, src_record_id) WHERE valid_until IS NULL` — partial; supports "outgoing edges from this node" queries.
- `ix_re_dst ON (dst_collection_id, dst_record_id) WHERE valid_until IS NULL` — partial; incoming-edge queries.
- `ix_re_undirected ON (LEAST(src_record_id, dst_record_id), GREATEST(src_record_id, dst_record_id)) WHERE directed = false`.
- GIN `ix_re_metadata ON (metadata jsonb_path_ops)` for edge-attribute filtering.

**`graph.graph_index_hint`** — per-collection per-edge-kind indexing strategy overrides for high-degree nodes.

| Column | Type | Default | Nullable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | `uuid` | `gen_random_uuid()` | NOT NULL | PK |
| `instance_id` | `uuid` | — | NULL | Same posture |
| `edge_kind` | `varchar(64)` | — | NOT NULL | UNIQUE per `(instance_id)` |
| `degree_skew_strategy` | `varchar(32)` | `'default'` | NOT NULL | CHECK ∈ `{default, materialized_neighbors, capped_fanout}`. `materialized_neighbors`: maintains a per-node materialized neighbor list to avoid scanning the partition for "neighbors of node X" with millions of edges. `capped_fanout`: traversal refuses to expand a node with > `max_fanout` edges. |
| `max_fanout` | `int` | — | NULL | Used when strategy = `capped_fanout` |
| `materialization_table` | `text` | — | NULL | When strategy = `materialized_neighbors`, the auxiliary table name |
| `created_at` | `timestamptz` | `now()` | NOT NULL | — |

#### 13.16.3 Services

`apps/api/src/app/graph/` (new module).

**`GraphEdgeService`** — `apps/api/src/app/graph/graph-edge.service.ts`:

```typescript
upsertEdge(input: EdgeInput, ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<RelationshipEdge>;
retireEdge(edgeId: string, ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<void>;
listEdges(filter: EdgeFilter, ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<RelationshipEdge[]>;
```

Edge writes flow through `withAudit`; pack-validator runs `cycle_check`/`orphan_check` per declared invariant.

**`GraphTraversalService`** — `apps/api/src/app/graph/graph-traversal.service.ts`:

```typescript
traverse(input: TraverseInput, ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<TraverseResult>;
routeSolve(input: RouteInput, ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<RouteResult>;
blastRadius(input: BlastRadiusInput, ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<BlastRadiusResult>;
```

`traverse(...)`:
- `{ startNodeCollectionId, startNodeRecordId, edgeFilter: { kinds: string[], metadataPredicate?, weightRange? }, depthLimit: 1-10, options: { algorithm: 'bfs' | 'dfs', cycleDetection: 'strict' | 'merge_revisit', maxNodes?: int } }`.
- §28 authz applied per-node: a traversal returning a node the user can't see is suppressed (with optional `omitted_count` in the response). Traversal cannot leak existence of forbidden nodes.
- Cycle detection: `strict` mode rejects when a cycle is encountered on a pack-declared DAG edge kind; `merge_revisit` allows but marks the revisit count.
- Honors `graph_index_hint.capped_fanout` — refuses to expand a node whose outgoing edge count exceeds the cap with `GRAPH_FANOUT_EXCEEDED` (avoids accidental N² scans).

`routeSolve(...)`:
- Bidirectional Dijkstra (or A* if `heuristic` provided) over edges filtered to `edgeFilter`.
- Returns `{ path: [{nodeId, edgeId, cumulativeWeight}], totalDistance, found: boolean }`.
- For floor-plan navigation (marquees #12, #24): Dijkstra over `corridor_links_rooms` + `room_contains_asset` edges with `weight = distance_meters` + door-locked filter from `metadata.door_locked_after_hours`.

`blastRadius(...)`:
- BFS from a starting node along `edge_kind` for `depth_limit` hops, intersected with a time window (returns nodes touched by the failure event within `time_window`).
- Used by Analyzer marquee #32 (blast-radius forensics on a suspected security incident).

#### 13.16.5 Validator extensions

Pack validator gains 4 publish gates:

1. **G16.1** — Pack `graph.edge_kinds[]` MUST declare `(kind, src_collection_id, dst_collection_id, directed, dag?: boolean)`. Error: `MISSING_EDGE_KIND_DECLARATION`.
2. **G16.2** — Edges declared `dag=true` cannot form cycles in seeded data; pack-install runs cycle-check via `GraphValidator.detectCycles`. Error: `CYCLE_IN_DAG_EDGE_KIND` (lists the offending cycle path).
3. **G16.3** — Spatial graph kinds (`corridor_links_rooms`, `floor_connects_to`) MUST NOT have orphan rooms (rooms with zero corridor connections) in seeded floor plans; orphan-check at pack install. Error: `ORPHAN_NODE_IN_SPATIAL_GRAPH` (lists orphan node IDs).
4. **G16.4** — `graph_index_hint.max_fanout` MUST be ≥ 50 (platform minimum). Error: `FANOUT_CAP_TOO_LOW`.

1. **`graph-edge-upsert.spec.ts`** — upsert edge; row written; partition picked correctly by `edge_kind`.
2. **`graph-retire-edge.spec.ts`** — retire edge; `valid_until` stamped; subsequent traversals exclude it; historical traversal (`as_of` timestamp option) still includes it.
3. **`graph-traverse-bfs.spec.ts`** — 5-node chain; traverse(depth=3) returns 3 hops; cycle in graph; `strict` mode rejects, `merge_revisit` mode marks revisit count.
4. **`graph-traverse-authz.spec.ts`** — user lacks §28 read on node X; traversal omits X; `omitted_count` reflects it.
5. **`graph-route-solve-shortest.spec.ts`** — corridor graph with multiple paths; routeSolve returns shortest weighted path.
6. **`graph-route-solve-door-locked.spec.ts`** — door locked after hours; routeSolve at 21:00 excludes that edge; finds alternate path or returns `found=false`.
7. **`graph-blast-radius-bfs.spec.ts`** — incident on node X; blastRadius(depth=2, time_window=1h) returns nodes reachable via `circuit_protects` edges within window.
8. **`graph-fanout-cap.spec.ts`** — node with 10k outgoing edges; `capped_fanout` strategy with `max_fanout=1000` refuses with `GRAPH_FANOUT_EXCEEDED`.
9. **`graph-cycle-detection-validator.spec.ts`** — pack seeds A→B→C→A on `asset_depends_on` (declared `dag=true`); pack install refused with G16.2.
10. **`graph-orphan-room-validator.spec.ts`** — pack seeds room R with no corridor edges; G16.3 refusal.
11. **`graph-cross-collection-edge.spec.ts`** — edge from `assets` (R1) to `rooms` (R2); upsert + traverse both directions; cross-collection edges work.

#### 13.17.3 Services

`apps/api/src/app/finance/` (new module).

**`ApprovalPolicyService`** — admin CRUD on `approval_limit_policy`. Authority: `finance:policy:manage` (`dangerous: true` — controls who can approve what).

**`TransactionApprovalService`** — `apps/api/src/app/finance/transaction-approval.service.ts`:

```typescript
request(input: ApprovalRequestInput, ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<TransactionApproval>;
approve(approvalId: string, reasonCodeId: string, ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<ApprovalDecision>;
reject(approvalId: string, reasonCodeId: string, ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<ApprovalDecision>;
withdraw(approvalId: string, ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<void>;
listPending(filter: PendingFilter, ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<TransactionApproval[]>;
```

`request(...)` flow:
1. Resolve `approval_limit_policy` rows matching `(scope_kind, scope_ref, transaction_kind, amount_cents)`. If amount exceeds the highest matching policy's `amount_max_cents`, refuse with `AMOUNT_EXCEEDS_POLICY`.
2. Validate `requester_user_id ≠ any role that holds approval authority on this transaction` — separation of duties; refuse with `SEPARATION_OF_DUTIES_VIOLATION` if requester is also a final approver per policy.
3. Compute initial `current_approver_role_id` (lowest-tier role whose policy covers the amount) + `pending_co_sign_role_ids` (the policy's `co_sign_role_ids`).
4. Insert `transaction_approval` row via `withAudit`; deliver notification to the approver role's members.

`approve(...)` flow:
1. Validate caller's roles include `current_approver_role_id` AND caller is NOT `requester_user_id`. Otherwise refuse with `SEPARATION_OF_DUTIES_VIOLATION` or `WRONG_APPROVER_ROLE`.
2. Require fresh WebAuthn re-auth (canon §13.7.5.1 `responsibility` tier).
3. Insert `electronic_signatures` row with `signature_meaning='approval'` + `reason_code_id`; append to `signature_chain_entry_ids[]`.
4. Append caller to `approved_by_user_ids[]`. Remove caller's role from `pending_co_sign_role_ids[]`.
5. If `pending_co_sign_role_ids` is now empty → stamp `status='approved'`, `decided_at=now()`. Emit `finance:transaction:approved` event for downstream workflows. If non-empty → advance `current_approver_role_id` to the next remaining role.
6. Return `{ approvalId, status, remainingCoSigners, signatureChainEntryId }`.

**`ThreeWayMatchService`** — `apps/api/src/app/finance/three-way-match.service.ts`:

```typescript
attemptMatch(input: MatchInput, ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<ThreeWayMatchResult>;
```

1. Resolve PO + Invoice + Receipt records; validate they're cross-linked (invoice references PO; receipt references PO).
2. Compute variances; resolve policy-defined `tolerance_cents`.
3. If `abs(variance_cents) > tolerance` AND `variance_reason_code_id` not supplied → refuse with `VARIANCE_REASON_REQUIRED`.
4. If variance reason has `requires_co_approval=true` → enqueue a follow-on `TransactionApproval` request.
5. Insert `three_way_match_record` via `withAudit`. Mark the PO/Invoice/Receipt records as matched (status transition on each).

**`BudgetEnvelopeService`** — `apps/api/src/app/finance/budget-envelope.service.ts`:

```typescript
allocate(input: AllocateInput, ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<BudgetEnvelope>;
checkAndConsume(input: ConsumeInput, ctx: RequestContext): Promise<ConsumeResult>;
```

`checkAndConsume(...)` runs inside the financial transaction's commit path:
1. SELECT envelope row FOR UPDATE (row-level lock).
2. Compute `would_consume = envelope.consumed_amount_cents + input.amount_cents`.
3. If `would_consume <= envelope.allocated_amount_cents` → UPDATE consumed_amount; return `{ allowed: true }`.
4. Else if policy `over_envelope_action='alert_and_allow'` → UPDATE + emit `RuntimeAnomaly`; return `{ allowed: true, over_by_cents }`.
5. Else if `block` → refuse with `BUDGET_ENVELOPE_EXCEEDED`.
6. Else if `require_executive_approval` → refuse + auto-create a `TransactionApproval` with `transaction_kind='executive_budget_override'` requesting executive approval.

`SeparationOfDutiesEvaluator` — extends canon §28 evaluator with a new check function `enforceSeparationOfDuties(action, ctx)`. Workflow transitions on `transaction_approval` invoke this; the §28 evaluator hard-rejects when the same user appears in both `requester_user_id` and `approved_by_user_ids` for amounts above the policy's separation-of-duties threshold.

#### 13.17.5 Validator extensions

Pack validator gains 3 publish gates:

1. **G17.1** — `approval_limit_policy.amount_max_cents` MUST NOT be NULL (unlimited approval would defeat the primitive's purpose). Error: `UNLIMITED_APPROVAL_LIMIT`.
2. **G17.2** — Pack `transaction_kind` values used in `transaction_approval` MUST be declared in pack manifest `finance.transaction_kinds[]`. Error: `UNDECLARED_TRANSACTION_KIND`.
3. **G17.3** — Pack workflows that transition a record to `approved` MUST call `TransactionApprovalService.approve` (not directly mutate). Pack-validator AST-scan detects direct mutation. Error: `BYPASS_APPROVAL_SERVICE`.

#### 13.18.3 Services

`apps/api/src/app/import/` (new API module) + `apps/worker/src/import/` (new worker module).

**`ImportBatchService`** — `apps/api/src/app/import/import-batch.service.ts`:

```typescript
ingest(input: IngestRequest, ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<ImportBatch>;
listRows(batchId: string, filter: RowFilter, ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<ImportRow[]>;
applyReviewerOverride(rowId: string, overrides: Record<string, unknown>, ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<void>;
setRowStatus(rowId: string, status: 'accepted' | 'rejected', ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<void>;
publish(batchId: string, ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<PublishResult>;
rollback(batchId: string, reason: string, ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<RollbackResult>;
abandon(batchId: string, reason: string, ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<void>;
```

`ingest(...)` flow:
1. Caller provides a `source_attachment_upload_id` (§3.12 clean attachment) OR an inline payload (for small batches < 1000 rows).
2. Authority: `import:batch:ingest` permission.
3. Parse the file format (CSV / XLSX / JSON) according to pack's `import.purposes[].format` declaration.
4. Insert `import_batch` row with `status='ingested', row_count=N`; bulk-insert `import_row` rows with `source_row_payload`.
5. Enqueue normalization job via `ImportNormalizationProcessor`.

`publish(...)` flow — the atomic-publish guarantee per §3.17 prose:
1. Authority: `import:batch:publish`.
2. Verify all `import_row.status ∈ {accepted, rejected}`; refuse with `UNREVIEWED_ROWS_EXIST` if any `pending`.
3. Inside a SINGLE database transaction:
   a. Set `import_batch.status='publishing'`.
   b. For each `import_row` with `status='accepted'`: merge `ava_normalized_payload` ⊕ `reviewer_overrides` → final payload; insert into `target_collection_id` via the standard `DataRecordService.create(...)` (so canon §28 validation + audit chain extension all flow). Stamp `import_row.published_record_id`.
   c. Set `import_batch.status='published', published_at=now(), published_by_user_id`.
   d. Compute `rollback_deadline = published_at + customer_policy.rollback_window_hours` (default 24).
   e. Audit chain extends with one summary row + N detail rows; the batch's audit row carries the per-row published IDs.
4. Return `{ batchId, publishedCount, rollbackDeadline }`.

`rollback(...)` flow:
1. Authority: `import:batch:rollback`.
2. Verify `status='published' AND rolled_back_at IS NULL AND rollback_deadline > now()`. Refuse with `ROLLBACK_WINDOW_EXPIRED` past the deadline.
3. Inside a transaction:
   - For each `import_row` with non-NULL `published_record_id`: SOFT-DELETE the published record via `DataRecordService.softDelete(...)` (record-not-deleted; status flipped to `archived` so audit chain remains intact).
   - Stamp `import_batch.status='rolled_back'`, `rolled_back_at`, `rolled_back_by_user_id`, `rollback_reason`.
   - High-severity audit event via `AccessAuditPort.logSecurityEvent({ severity: 'high', kind: 'bulk_import_rollback', ... })`.
4. Return `{ rolledBackCount }`.

**`ImportNormalizationProcessor`** — worker:
1. Read batch's `source_row_payload` rows.
2. For each row, invoke pack's declared AVA normalization tool (`AVATool` registered for purpose).
3. Stamp `ava_normalized_payload` + `ava_confidence_per_field`.
4. When all rows normalized, set `import_batch.status='reviewable'`; notify the assigned reviewer.
5. Compute `ava_confidence_summary` aggregate.

**`RollbackWindowExpiryProcessor`** — worker; daily scheduled:
- Selects published batches whose `rollback_deadline < now() - INTERVAL '7 days'` (a grace window after deadline for forensic queries); archives the `source_row_payload` JSON to cold storage; nullifies the column to reclaim DB space. Doesn't delete batches — they remain queryable forever (canon §10 audit retention applies).

7. **`import-rollback-window-expired.spec.ts`** — rollback attempt > 24h after publish → `ROLLBACK_WINDOW_EXPIRED`.
8. **`import-customer-rollback-window-policy.spec.ts`** — customer policy `rollback_window_hours=72`; rollback at 48h succeeds.
9. **`import-abandon.spec.ts`** — abandon `reviewable` batch; status `abandoned`; rows never published.
10. **`import-rollback-high-severity-audit.spec.ts`** — rollback writes `AccessAuditPort.logSecurityEvent` with `severity='high'`, `kind='bulk_import_rollback'`.
11. **`import-validator-undeclared-tool.spec.ts`** — pack declares `normalization_tool_name='unknownTool'`; G18.3 publish refusal.

### 13.19 Worked example: §3.18 Integration Secrets + Egress Policy (full artifact-level spec — KMS-encrypted secrets + deny-all egress allowlist + per-adapter killswitch + NAC dual-confirmation)

#### 13.19.1 Tables

Four new tables, two in `schema: 'integrations'` (existing from §13.14) and two NEW.

**`integrations.integration_secret`** — KMS-encrypted secret values; never exposed in API responses.

UNIQUE `(instance_id, adapter_id, target_host, target_port, target_protocol)`; `ix_eae_adapter_active ON (adapter_id, is_active) WHERE is_active = true`.

**`integrations.outbound_call_log`** — every outbound HTTP/TCP call; partitioned monthly via pg_partman.

| Column | Type | Default | Nullable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | `bigserial` | — | NOT NULL | PK component with `called_at` |

CREATE TABLE integrations.outbound_call_log (...) PARTITION BY RANGE (called_at);
SELECT partman.create_parent('integrations.outbound_call_log', 'called_at', 'native', 'monthly', p_premake := 3);
```

Indexes (per monthly partition): PK on `(id, called_at)`; BRIN on `(called_at)`; `ix_ocl_adapter_verdict ON (adapter_id, verdict, called_at DESC)`; `ix_ocl_correlation ON (correlation_id) WHERE correlation_id IS NOT NULL`.

#### 13.19.3 Services

`apps/api/src/app/integrations/secrets/` (new submodule) + `apps/worker/src/integrations/egress/` (new submodule).

**`IntegrationSecretService`** — `apps/api/src/app/integrations/secrets/integration-secret.service.ts`:

```typescript
create(input: CreateSecretInput, ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<{ secretHandle: string }>;
rotate(secretHandle: string, newValue: string, ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<void>;
delete(secretHandle: string, ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<void>;
listMetadata(filter: SecretFilter, ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<SecretMetadata[]>;  // never includes encrypted_value
```

Plaintext secrets enter the system ONLY via `create` and `rotate`, and ONLY when the caller holds `integrations:secret:manage` (`dangerous: true`). Encryption: `KMSClient.encrypt({ KeyId: kms_key_arn, Plaintext: Buffer.from(value, 'utf-8') })`; ciphertext stored. The plaintext is held in memory for ≤ the duration of one HTTP request; never logged.

**`SecretResolver`** — internal helper used by adapters at call time:

```typescript
async resolve(secretHandle: string, instanceId: string): Promise<Buffer>;
```

Per call:
1. Look up `integration_secret` row by `(instance_id, secret_handle)`.
2. Call KMS Decrypt with the row's `encrypted_value`.
3. Atomic UPDATE `last_used_at = now(), use_count = use_count + 1`.
4. Return plaintext Buffer; caller MUST zero the buffer after use (helper provided).

`SecretResolver` is NOT exposed via any HTTP endpoint. It's package-internal to `apps/api/src/app/integrations/` and `apps/worker/src/integrations/`. Service-boundary scanner forbids imports from any other package.

**`EgressAllowlistEnforcer`** — wraps every outbound HTTP/TCP call from worker:

```typescript
async authorizedCall<T>(adapterId: string, op: () => Promise<T>, target: { host: string; port: number; protocol: string }): Promise<T>;
```

1. Check `adapter_killswitch_state` for the adapter; if `killed=true` → write `outbound_call_log` row with `verdict='blocked_by_killswitch'`; throw `KillSwitchActive`.
2. Check `egress_allowlist_entry` for `(adapter_id, target_host, target_port, target_protocol)`; if no active entry → write log with `verdict='blocked_by_allowlist'`; throw `EgressNotAllowlisted`.
3. Start timer; invoke `op()`; measure latency.
4. On success: write log with `verdict='success', latency_ms, response_status, response_size_bytes`.
5. On error: write log with `verdict='error_returned'`; rethrow.

Every adapter's actual HTTP client (axios / undici / node-fetch) MUST be wrapped in `authorizedCall(...)`. The new `tools/egress-enforcer-check.ts` scanner (introduced in PR-6) greps adapter code for unwrapped HTTP-client calls; violations fail CI.

**`KillswitchService`** — `apps/api/src/app/integrations/secrets/killswitch.service.ts`:

```typescript
trip(adapterId: string, reason: string, ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<void>;
reset(adapterId: string, reason: string, ctx: UserRequestContext): Promise<void>;
```

`trip(...)` for the NAC-quarantine adapter (§3.18 prose) follows special dual-confirmation:
1. First call: insert/update row with `dual_confirmation_state.confirmer_1_*` set; row's `killed` stays `false` (or `true` based on direction — trip=true setting it false would be backwards; trip raises killed to `true` to STOP quarantine).
2. Second call from a DIFFERENT user with role `maintenance_manager` (when first was `security_officer`, or vice versa) flips `killed = true` IF customer-override flag set AND `safety_check_passed_evidence_id` present.
3. Missing requirements → refuse with `NAC_GUARDRAIL_NOT_SATISFIED` listing missing pieces.

(Important note: the NAC-quarantine adapter's "killswitch" semantically prevents accidental clinical-operations impact — it requires more checks to ARM than to disarm. Other adapters use the simpler single-call trip/reset.)

#### 13.19.4 API endpoints

| Method | Path | Boundary | Body / params |
|---|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/api/integrations/secrets` | `@RequirePermission('integrations:secret:manage')` (`dangerous: true`) | `{ adapterId, secretHandle, value, valueKind, expiresAt? }` — value never logged |
| `POST` | `/api/integrations/secrets/:handle/rotate` | `@RequirePermission('integrations:secret:manage')` | `{ value }` |
| `DELETE` | `/api/integrations/secrets/:handle` | `@RequirePermission('integrations:secret:manage')` | `{ reason }` |
| `GET` | `/api/integrations/secrets` | `@RequirePermission('integrations:secret:read')` | — never returns plaintext |
| `POST` | `/api/integrations/egress-allowlist` | `@RequirePermission('integrations:egress:manage')` (`dangerous: true`) | entry params |
| `DELETE` | `/api/integrations/egress-allowlist/:id` | `@RequirePermission('integrations:egress:manage')` | `{ reason }` |
| `GET` | `/api/integrations/egress-allowlist` | `@RequirePermission('integrations:egress:read')` | — |

| `GET` | `/api/integrations/killswitch/:adapterId` | `@RequirePermission('integrations:killswitch:read')` | — |

#### 13.19.5 Validator extensions

Pack validator gains 4 publish gates:

1. **G19.1** — Pack `integrations[]` MUST declare an `egress_allowlist[]` enumerating every outbound destination it needs. Install refuses if any declared destination is missing from instance `egress_allowlist_entry` rows. Error: `MISSING_EGRESS_ALLOWLIST_ENTRY` (install-time, not publish-time).
2. **G19.2** — Pack adapter code MUST wrap every outbound HTTP/TCP client call in `EgressAllowlistEnforcer.authorizedCall(...)`. AST-scan detects unwrapped calls. Error: `BYPASS_EGRESS_ENFORCER`.
3. **G19.3** — `nac-quarantine` adapter declarations MUST include `dual_confirmation_required = true` AND `safety_check_evidence_kind = '<kind>'`. Error: `NAC_QUARANTINE_MISSING_GUARDRAILS`.
4. **G19.4** — Adapter code MUST resolve secrets only through `SecretResolver.resolve(...)`. AST-scan for direct `integration_secret.encrypted_value` reads outside the resolver fails CI. Error: `DIRECT_SECRET_READ`.

#### 13.19.6 Service-boundary scanner rules + NEW egress scanner

| Entity | Allowed writers |
|---|---|
| `IntegrationSecret` | `IntegrationSecretService.*` |
| `EgressAllowlistEntry` | `EgressAllowlistService.*` |
| `OutboundCallLog` | `EgressAllowlistEnforcer.authorizedCall` only |
| `AdapterKillswitchState` | `KillswitchService.*` |

`tools/egress-enforcer-check.ts` (NEW scanner): greps `apps/worker/src/integrations/**` and `apps/api/src/app/integrations/**` for HTTP-client imports (`axios`, `undici`, `node-fetch`, `got`, `request`); for each, asserts that the call is wrapped in `EgressAllowlistEnforcer.authorizedCall(...)` within the same function. Unwrapped HTTP calls fail CI with `UNWRAPPED_EGRESS_CALL`.

Self-test: 8 assertions covering (a) wrapped call passes; (b) unwrapped axios.get fails; (c) unwrapped fetch fails; (d) wrapped via different identifier name passes; (e) commented-out unwrapped call doesn't fail (false-positive guard); (f) non-adapter directory ignored; (g) Windows + Linux path stability; (h) self-test runs deterministically.

#### 13.19.7 Tests (self-test ≥ 14 assertions)

1. **`secret-create-and-resolve.spec.ts`** — create secret; `SecretResolver.resolve` returns plaintext that matches original; `last_used_at` + `use_count` updated.
2. **`secret-never-leaked-in-response.spec.ts`** — `GET /secrets` response body never contains plaintext OR `encrypted_value` (only metadata).
3. **`secret-rotation.spec.ts`** — rotate; old plaintext no longer decrypts; new value resolves correctly; `rotated_at` updated.
4. **`secret-direct-read-scanner.spec.ts`** — adding adapter code that reads `integration_secret.encrypted_value` directly fails G19.4 AST-scan.
5. **`egress-deny-all-default.spec.ts`** — fresh adapter with no allowlist entries; `authorizedCall` blocks with `EgressNotAllowlisted`; `outbound_call_log` records `verdict='blocked_by_allowlist'`.
6. **`egress-allowlist-grant.spec.ts`** — add allowlist entry; subsequent call succeeds; log row `verdict='success'`.
7. **`egress-enforcer-scanner.spec.ts`** — add direct `axios.get(...)` in adapter code; `egress-enforcer-check.ts` fails CI.
8. **`killswitch-trip.spec.ts`** — trip killswitch on `hl7v2`; subsequent calls fail with `KillSwitchActive`; log `verdict='blocked_by_killswitch'`.
9. **`killswitch-reset.spec.ts`** — reset; calls succeed again.
10. **`killswitch-nac-dual-confirmation.spec.ts`** — single security officer trip → refused with `NAC_GUARDRAIL_NOT_SATISFIED`; second user (maintenance_manager) AFTER customer override + safety check evidence → trip succeeds.
11. **`killswitch-nac-missing-evidence.spec.ts`** — both confirmers present but `safety_check_passed_evidence_id` missing → still refused.
12. **`outbound-log-partition.spec.ts`** — pg_partman creates next-month partition; log row lands in correct partition by `called_at`.
13. **`outbound-log-correlation-id.spec.ts`** — outbound call from inside an inbound request flow carries `correlation_id`; allows tracing inbound→outbound paths in audit.
14. **`secret-expiration-alert.spec.ts`** — secret with `expires_at` in 24h; scheduled job emits `RuntimeAnomaly` with kind `secret_expiring_soon`.

### 13.20 Worked example: §3.19 Universal Customer Customization Override (full artifact-level spec — the customization-vs-upgrade moat across all 9 surfaces)

#### 13.20.1 Tables

**`metadata.customization_overrides`** — ONE platform table covering all 9 customization surfaces; per-surface adapters interpret `override_spec` per their schema.

| Column | Type | Default | Nullable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | `uuid` | `gen_random_uuid()` | NOT NULL | PK |
| `customer_id` | `uuid` | — | NULL | NULL in single-tenant mode (canon §5); NOT NULL in pooled mode (RLS-enforced) |
| `target_kind` | `varchar(32)` | — | NOT NULL | CHECK ∈ `{workflow, automation_rule, form_definition, view, workspace_page, property_validator, collection_access_rule, notification_template, ava_tool_config}` |
| `target_pack_id` | `text` | — | NOT NULL | Which pack ships the target artifact (e.g., `maintenance-core`) |
| `target_artifact_id` | `text` | — | NOT NULL | Stable identifier of the artifact within the pack (e.g., workflow `wf_wo_intake`; form `f_wo_detail`) |
| `target_sub_path` | `text` | — | NULL | When override targets a specific child (e.g., workflow state name `step_2`; form field `serial_number`); NULL when override applies to whole artifact |
| `override_kind` | `varchar(32)` | — | NOT NULL | CHECK ∈ `{skip, modify, replace, add, remove}` |
| `override_spec` | `jsonb` | — | NOT NULL | Per-surface schema for the change content (validated by per-surface adapter) |
| `target_platform_api_version` | `varchar(32)` | — | NOT NULL | Semver of the platform release the override was authored against |
| `priority` | `smallint` | `100` | NOT NULL | Lower applied first; conflicts resolved by priority then `created_at` asc |
| `signature_chain_id` | `uuid` | — | NOT NULL | UNIQUE; FK → `compliance.signature_chains(id)`; every override creation is signed via §3.6 with `signature_meaning='approval'` |
| `audit_log_id` | `uuid` | — | NOT NULL | UNIQUE; FK |
| `created_by_user_id` | `uuid` | — | NOT NULL | FK |
| `is_active` | `boolean` | `true` | NOT NULL | Deactivation does NOT cascade — runtime check is `WHERE is_active = true AND target_platform_api_version_compatible(...)` |
| `created_at` | `timestamptz` | `now()` | NOT NULL | — |
| `updated_at` | `timestamptz` | `now()` | NOT NULL | Trigger-maintained |

Indexes: PK; `ix_co_lookup ON (target_kind, target_pack_id, target_artifact_id, is_active) WHERE is_active = true` — the merge engine's primary hot-path index; `ix_co_customer ON (customer_id, target_kind, created_at DESC)` — per-customer audit + admin queries; `ix_co_priority_load ON (target_kind, target_pack_id, target_artifact_id, priority, created_at) WHERE is_active = true` — deterministic merge ordering.

CHECK constraint: `(override_kind = 'replace' OR override_kind = 'add') = (override_spec ? 'customer_artifact_ref')` — replace/add overrides MUST reference a customer-namespaced artifact in `override_spec.customer_artifact_ref`.

**Customer-namespaced replacement tables (per canon §17.5):**

Customer artifacts referenced by `replace` / `add` overrides live in pack-namespaced customer tables:
- `cust__{pack_id}__customizations__workflow_definition` — customer-authored workflow replacements
- `cust__{pack_id}__customizations__form_definition` — customer-authored form replacements
- `cust__{pack_id}__customizations__automation_rule` — customer-authored automation rules
- `cust__{pack_id}__customizations__view` — customer-authored view definitions
- `cust__{pack_id}__customizations__workspace_page` — customer-authored workspace pages
- `cust__{pack_id}__customizations__notification_template` — customer-authored notification templates
- `cust__{pack_id}__customizations__ava_tool_config` — customer-authored AVA tool configs

These tables are pack-namespaced per canon §17.5; their schemas follow the corresponding pack-shipped artifact schemas. `customization_overrides.override_spec.customer_artifact_ref` resolves to a row in the relevant customer-namespaced table.

#### 13.20.4 Services

`apps/api/src/app/customization/` (new module):

**`UniversalOverrideMergeEngine`** — `apps/api/src/app/customization/universal-override-merge.engine.ts`:

```typescript
async mergeForExecution<TArtifact>(
  packArtifact: TArtifact,
  targetKind: CustomizationTargetKind,
  targetPackId: string,
  targetArtifactId: string,
  ctx: RequestContext
): Promise<{ effective: TArtifact; appliedOverrides: CustomizationOverride[] }>;
```

Flow:
1. Lookup active overrides via `ix_co_lookup` partial index — filtered by `(target_kind, target_pack_id, target_artifact_id, is_active=true, target_platform_api_version_compatible)`.
2. Order by priority asc, then created_at asc.
3. Resolve per-surface adapter via `OverrideAdapterRegistry.resolve(target_kind)`.
4. Adapter applies overrides one-by-one to packArtifact, producing effective artifact.
5. Cap nesting depth at 3 (e.g., a customer-added state being further overridden by another override) — depth limit prevents override storms.
6. Return effective artifact + applied overrides (for audit trail at runtime).

**Per-surface override adapter contract** — `apps/api/src/app/customization/adapters/<surface>-override.adapter.ts`:

```typescript
interface OverrideAdapter<TArtifact> {
  readonly targetKind: CustomizationTargetKind;
  applyOverride(artifact: TArtifact, override: CustomizationOverride): TArtifact;
  validateOverrideSpec(spec: Record<string, unknown>, packArtifact: TArtifact): ValidationResult;
  classifyOnUpgrade(override: CustomizationOverride, newPackArtifact: TArtifact, oldPackArtifact: TArtifact): UpgradeClassification;
}

type UpgradeClassification = 'green' | { kind: 'yellow', autoMigration: AutoMigrationSpec } | { kind: 'red', reason: string, remediation: string };
```

Nine adapter implementations:
1. `WorkflowOverrideAdapter` — handles skip_state / modify_guard / modify_side_effect / replace_state / add_state / replace_entire
2. `AutomationRuleOverrideAdapter` — skip / modify_condition / modify_action / replace
3. `FormDefinitionOverrideAdapter` — skip_field / modify_field / replace_field / add_field / remove_field / replace_entire
4. `ViewOverrideAdapter` — modify_columns / modify_filters / replace (already partially handled by canon §7 layering; this adapter formalizes it)
5. `WorkspacePageOverrideAdapter` — modify_layout / replace_widget / add_widget / remove_widget
6. `PropertyValidatorOverrideAdapter` — modify_predicate / add_validator / remove_validator
7. `CollectionAccessRuleOverrideAdapter` — add_rule (customer adds; never modifies pack's default rule which is platform-invariant for the pack's documented permissions) / modify_row_condition (only if pack declared the rule overridable)
8. `NotificationTemplateOverrideAdapter` — modify_body / modify_subject / modify_channels / replace
9. `AvaToolConfigOverrideAdapter` — modify_trust_state / modify_confidence_threshold / modify_prompt_template

Adapters are registered via `OverrideAdapterRegistry` on module boot; the merge engine dispatches by `target_kind`.

**`PackArtifactOverridePolicyService`** — checks pack-shipped artifacts have `override_policy` declared:

```typescript
async validateOverridePolicyCoverage(packManifest: PackManifest): Promise<ValidationResult>;
```

Pack-validator extension that runs at pack publish. Refuses pack if any pack-shipped workflow / automation_rule / form_definition / etc. lacks an `override_policy` declaration. Default is NOT inferred; pack authors MUST explicitly declare `override_policy: false` (platform-invariant) or `override_policy: { kinds: [...], reason: '...' }` (customer-overridable).

**`UpgradeOverrideClassifier`** — `apps/api/src/app/customization/upgrade-override-classifier.ts`:

```typescript
async classifyAllOverridesForUpgrade(
  currentPackManifest: PackManifest,
  newPackManifest: PackManifest,
  customerId: string | null
): Promise<UpgradeOverrideReport>;
```

Run at upgrade time (before upgrade ships):
1. Query all `customization_overrides` rows where `target_pack_id = packId AND is_active = true`.
2. For each override: resolve the appropriate adapter; call `adapter.classifyOnUpgrade(override, newPackArtifact, oldPackArtifact)`.
3. Aggregate: count green / yellow / red.
4. If `red_count > 0`: upgrade refuses; structured error report lists each red override with `target_kind / target_pack_id / target_artifact_id / customer_id / reason / remediation`.
5. If `red_count = 0 AND yellow_count > 0`: upgrade proceeds, auto-migration applied per yellow's `autoMigration` spec; audit trail captures the migration.
6. If `red_count = 0 AND yellow_count = 0`: upgrade proceeds clean.

**`CustomizationOverrideService`** — admin CRUD on overrides (create / list / deactivate). Override creation requires §3.6 signature; deactivation requires `customization:override:manage` permission.

#### 13.20.5 API endpoints

| Method | Path | Boundary | Body / params |
|---|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/api/customization/overrides` | `@RequirePermission('customization:override:create')` | `{ targetKind, targetPackId, targetArtifactId, targetSubPath?, overrideKind, overrideSpec, priority?, signatureChainPayload }` |
| `GET` | `/api/customization/overrides` | `@RequirePermission('customization:override:read')` | query: `targetKind?`, `targetPackId?`, `customerId?`, `active?` |
| `GET` | `/api/customization/overrides/:id` | `@RequirePermission('customization:override:read')` | — |
| `PATCH` | `/api/customization/overrides/:id` | `@RequirePermission('customization:override:manage')` | `{ isActive?, priority? }` (override_spec is IMMUTABLE — to change, deactivate + create new) |
| `DELETE` | `/api/customization/overrides/:id` | `@RequirePermission('customization:override:manage')` (`dangerous: true`) | `{ reason }` |
| `POST` | `/api/customization/upgrade-classify` | `@RequirePermission('customization:upgrade:run')` | `{ newPackManifest }` returns `UpgradeOverrideReport` |
| `GET` | `/api/customization/override-policies` | `@RequirePermission('metadata:pack:read')` | query: `packId?` — returns pack-author-declared override_policy entries for all customizable artifacts |

New permission codes:
- `customization:override:create`, `customization:override:read`, `customization:override:manage` (`dangerous: true` on the latter)
- `customization:upgrade:run` (admin-only)

#### 13.20.6 Validator extensions

Pack validator gains 4 publish gates:

1. **G20.1** — Every pack-shipped workflow / automation_rule / form_definition / view / workspace_page / property_validator / collection_access_rule / notification_template / ava_tool_config MUST declare `override_policy` (explicit; no inference). Error: `MISSING_OVERRIDE_POLICY_DECLARATION` with artifact path.
2. **G20.2** — `override_policy.kinds[]` values MUST be in the canonical enum subset for the target_kind (e.g., workflow may declare `['skip_state', 'modify_guard', 'modify_side_effect', 'replace_state', 'add_state', 'replace_entire']`; form_definition may declare `['skip_field', 'modify_field', ...]`). Error: `INVALID_OVERRIDE_KIND_FOR_TARGET_KIND`.
3. **G20.3** — Pack declaring `override_policy: false` on an artifact MUST provide a `reason` (documentation string explaining why this is platform-invariant). Error: `OVERRIDE_POLICY_FALSE_REQUIRES_REASON`.
4. **G20.4** — Per-pack `migration_manifest.yaml` MUST include rename hints for any artifact whose stable identifier changed between releases (`oldId → newId`) — the classifier reads this to produce yellow auto-migrations. Without rename hints, the classifier treats renames as red (target removed). Error: `MISSING_RENAME_HINT_IN_MIGRATION_MANIFEST`.

#### 13.20.7 Service-boundary scanner rules

`tools/service-boundary-check.ts` `KNOWN_WRITES` table gains:

| Entity | Allowed writers |
|---|---|
| `CustomizationOverride` | `CustomizationOverrideService.*`, `UpgradeOverrideClassifier.applyAutoMigration` (yellow rebind) |

`tools/customization-coverage-check.ts` (NEW scanner): scans pack manifests in `packs/*/manifest.yaml` for missing `override_policy` declarations on customizable surfaces; flags packs that omit the declaration on any pack-shipped workflow/form/etc. Self-test: 12 assertions covering (a) workflow without override_policy → fail; (b) workflow with `override_policy: false` and no reason → fail; (c) workflow with `override_policy: {kinds: ['invalid_kind']}` → fail; (d) workflow with valid declaration → pass; (e) all 9 surfaces enumerated and validated; (f) missing rename hint on identifier change → fail; (g) duplicate override_policy on same artifact → fail; (h) override_policy on non-customizable surface (e.g., a system column) → fail.

#### 13.20.8 Tests (self-test ≥ 18 assertions across 5-scenario fixture + per-surface adapters)

Integration tests at `apps/api/test/integration/customization-overrides-*.spec.ts`:

**5-scenario fixture (workflow surface; covers the user's RFP scenario set):**
1. **`customization-scenario-1-as-is.spec.ts`** — Client 1: no override rows; pack workflow runs steps 1→2→3→4 unchanged.
2. **`customization-scenario-2-skip-step.spec.ts`** — Client 2: one `skip` override on step_2; engine runs 1→3→4; audit trail captures override application.
3. **`customization-scenario-3-replace-step.spec.ts`** — Client 3: one `replace` override on step_3 with `customer_artifact_ref` to `cust__maintenance_core__customizations__workflow_definition.id=...` containing custom state; engine runs 1→2→custom→4.
4. **`customization-scenario-4-modify-partial.spec.ts`** — Client 4: one `modify` override on step_2's guard predicate (relaxed condition); engine runs 1→2(modified)→3→4.
5. **`customization-scenario-5-replace-entire.spec.ts`** — Client 5: one `replace` override targeting whole workflow with `customer_artifact_ref` to customer-namespaced workflow definition; engine runs customer's workflow entirely.

**Per-surface adapter tests (≥ 1 happy-path test per surface; 9 total):**
6. **`customization-adapter-workflow.spec.ts`** — all 6 workflow override_kinds round-trip.
7. **`customization-adapter-automation-rule.spec.ts`** — skip / modify_condition / replace.
8. **`customization-adapter-form-definition.spec.ts`** — skip_field / modify_field / add_field / remove_field; respects §13.8 G8.4 mobile-eligibility on sync-eligible collections.
9. **`customization-adapter-view.spec.ts`** — modify_columns / modify_filters; integration with canon §7 layering (customer override is HIGHER priority than role view but LOWER priority than personal view).
10. **`customization-adapter-workspace-page.spec.ts`** — modify_layout / replace_widget / add_widget; respects UI Builder authoring contract.
11. **`customization-adapter-property-validator.spec.ts`** — modify_predicate doesn't violate property's `confidentiality_class` hard-deny constraints (cannot override a `never_reveal` property's validator to be more permissive).
12. **`customization-adapter-collection-access-rule.spec.ts`** — add_rule only; cannot modify pack's default rule (platform-invariant per pack); customer's added rule passes through canon §28 evaluator with proper priority.
13. **`customization-adapter-notification-template.spec.ts`** — modify_body / modify_channels; template variable references validated against pack data.
14. **`customization-adapter-ava-tool-config.spec.ts`** — modify_trust_state (Suggest→Preview→Execute progression; customer can DOWNGRADE trust but cannot UPGRADE past pack's declared maximum trust).

**Upgrade classifier tests:**
15. **`customization-upgrade-green.spec.ts`** — target artifact unchanged across pack versions → green; upgrade proceeds.
16. **`customization-upgrade-yellow.spec.ts`** — target renamed AND migration_manifest has rename hint → yellow; auto-migration applied; override re-bound; audit trail captures rebind.
17. **`customization-upgrade-red.spec.ts`** — target removed → red; upgrade REFUSED with structured error listing affected customer + remediation; new pack version NOT installed.
18. **`customization-coverage-scanner.spec.ts`** — pack missing `override_policy` declaration → scanner fails CI.

## 14. Pack Composition Implementation Plans

§13's worked examples specify the platform's 18 substrate primitives. §14 specifies how the four customer-facing packs compose those primitives. Each pack section follows the same shape: collections (with taskable/sync/vector flags + key columns + substrate dependencies), workflows (state machines with transitions/guards/audit), automation rules, views, workspaces, plugin components, integration adapters, and PR breakdown.

The pack specs are denser than substrate worked examples because each enumerates ~50 collections, ~20 workflows, and ~30 plugins. Per-item depth is calibrated so the spec is implementable without further design (column types implicit when canonical; full property catalogs deferred to pack manifest files that ship with the pack code).

### 14.1 `maintenance-core` pack (~25 PRs)

The platform's flagship pack — every overlay (clinical, facilities, OT-security) composes on top. 51 collections, 18 workflows, ~25 automation rules, ~50 views, 9 workspaces, 32 React+RN plugin components, 7 integration adapters.

#### 14.1.1 Collections (51 total)

All collections live in `schema: 'maintenance_core'` and are pack-namespaced under `cust__maintenance_core__<collection_id>` for customer-namespaced extensions (canon §17.5). Taskable collections opt into the §3.1 capability; regulated collections require §3.6 reason codes + e-signatures on closure transitions; mobile-sync collections declare a `mobile_sync_policies` row per §3.7.

**Pack-specific feature collections (4 collections per marquees #33, #35):**

| Collection | Taskable | Sync→Mobile | Vector | Key properties | Substrate dependencies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `asset_import_batch` | ✓ | — | — | Thin alias / view over `import.import_batch` with `purpose='asset_commissioning'`. Pack-side normalization rules implement asset-specific AVA tool. | §3.17 import primitive |
| `key_record` | — | ✓ assigned_only | — | `id`, `key_serial`, `key_class` (master/sub_master/operating/control), `parent_master_key_id`, `opens_locks[]` (lock_ids), `status` (issued/recovered/lost/destroyed), `current_custodian_user_id` | §3.15 graph (key hierarchy) |
| `key_assignment` | ✓ regulated | ✓ assigned_only | — | `id`, `key_record_id`, `assigned_to_user_id`, `assigned_by_user_id`, `assigned_at`, `expected_return_at`, `actual_return_at`, `signature_chain_id`, `status` | §3.1; §3.6 signature |
| `unrecovered_key_flag` | ✓ | — | — | `id`, `key_assignment_id`, `terminated_user_id`, `flag_created_at`, `recovery_wo_id`, `escalation_state`, `cleared_at` | §3.1 |

**Total: 51 collections.** All §28 access rules are seeded by the pack installer with role grants to the 7 maintenance personas (technician, dispatcher, maintenance_manager, biomed_engineer, facilities_manager, compliance_officer, fca_inspector); ABAC rules constrain by `location_id` cost-center where applicable.

#### 14.1.2 Workflows (18 state machines)

Each workflow is a state machine on a taskable collection. States, transitions, guards, audit events, and roles authorized are pack-manifest declarations. Format below: state diagram (terse ASCII) + transition table.

**WF-1: WO intake/triage** (on `maintenance_work_order`)
```
draft → submitted → triaged → assigned → in_progress → blocked → in_progress → completed
                              → rejected
                              → entitlement_intercept (marquee #23)
```
Roles: `requester` submits; `dispatcher` triages + assigns; `technician` advances in_progress/blocked/completed. Audit on every transition. Guards: `triaged` requires `priority` set; `entitlement_intercept` requires `vendor_id` resolved + service_contract lookup.

**WF-2: WO triage with entitlement intercept** (extension of WF-1 per marquee #23)
- On triage, if asset has an active `service_contract` covering the failure mode, divert to vendor workflow before assigning internal technician.
- Transitions: `triaged → entitlement_proposed → vendor_dispatched → vendor_completed → human_close_out`. Guards: `entitlement_proposed` requires AVA's contract match + confidence ≥ 0.85.

**WF-3: WO approval** (separate from WF-1 for high-value orders > approval threshold)
- States: `awaiting_approval → approved → in_progress` OR `awaiting_approval → rejected`. Uses §3.16 `TransactionApprovalService.request/approve/reject`. Required when WO estimated cost > policy threshold.

**WF-4: PM generation orchestration** (on `pm_schedule`)
- Triggered by §3.3 scheduling primitives on `next_due_at`. State: `pending → wo_generated → completed`. Guards: idempotency on `next_due_at` (no double-generation). Failure path: `pending → generation_failed` emits `RuntimeAnomaly`.

**WF-5: Calibration signoff** (on inspection where `inspection_kind='calibration'`)
- States: `scheduled → in_progress → calibrated → signed_off → expired`. `signed_off` requires §3.6 closure signature with `signature_meaning='verification'`; certificate attachment via §3.12.

**WF-6: Recall remediation** (on `recall_response`)
- States: `pending → in_progress → remediated → verified → closed`. `verified` requires §3.6 e-signature + evidence attachment. SLA driven by advisory severity.

**WF-7: FCA review** (lite version; full version in facilities overlay §14.3)
- States: `scheduled → in_progress → findings_logged → resolved`. Each finding creates a `deficiency` row.

**WF-8: Permit-to-work auth** (on `permit_to_work`)
- States: `requested → hazard_assessed → authorized → loto_in_progress → work_in_progress → loto_removed → closed`. Every transition with §3.6 signature; `loto_step_check` rows accumulate.

**WF-9: Parts reorder**
- Triggered by `parts_catalog.reorder_threshold` watch + automation rule. States: `triggered → procurement_proposal_drafted → po_generated → received → stock_updated`. Uses §3.16 financial controls if total > approval threshold.

**WF-10: AEM review** (lite; full clinical version in §14.2)
- States: `assessed → committee_review → outcome (membership_added | excluded | re-evaluate)`. Used for non-clinical equivalents (e.g., legacy industrial equipment).

**WF-11: WO escalation loop** (background; not user-driven)
- Triggered by SLA timer: `sla_warning → sla_breached → escalated_to_manager`. Generates §3.5 anomaly when breached.

**WF-12: WO close-out**
- States: `completed → review → closed_final` OR `completed → reopened`. `closed_final` requires checklist 100% complete + closure signature (§3.6) + cost reconciliation against `purchase_order` if any.

**WF-13: round_completion_review** (on `work_round_session`; marquee #25)
- Observation entries flow into §3.5; only failed observations spawn reactive `maintenance_work_order`. States: `started → in_progress → completed → reviewed`. NOT taskable — the round itself is sample-not-task; only spawned WOs become tasks.

**WF-14: contract_renewal_cycle** (on `service_contract`)
- Scheduled checks at T-90, T-30, T-7 from `end_date` emit notifications; T-0 transitions `service_contract.status` to `expiring` then `expired`. Renewal path branches to `procurement_proposal` flow for new MSA/contract.

**WF-15: capital_replacement_review** (per marquee #27, on `capital_replacement_request`)
- States: `proposed → director_review → approved → procurement_proposal_linked → asset_decommissioned`. Director approval uses §3.16 with `transaction_kind='capital_purchase'`. Auto-decommission writes `asset.status='decommissioned'` + cascades `pm_asset_assignment` deactivation.

**WF-16: procurement_proposal_approval** (per marquee #28)
- States: `proposed → reviewed → approved_to_po → po_generated`. AVA drafts; Procurement Manager Approves All / Edits / Skips per line. Approved lines flow to `purchase_order` creation.

**WF-17: vendor_invoice_reconciliation** (per marquee #29)
- States: `received → ai_reconciled → matched | discrepancy_flagged → human_review → approved → paid`. AI reconciliation cross-references `time_on_site` + MSA rate card + `parts_consumption`. §3.16 three-way match record on success.

**WF-18: fleet_telematics_to_pm** (per marquee #30)
- Triggered by OBD2 mileage threshold breach (via §3.5 observation alert). States: `threshold_breached → pm_schedule_consulted → wo_generated`. Idempotent via `pm_schedule.last_generated_at + meter_reading_snapshot`.

**WF-19: asset_import_commissioning** (per marquee #33) — delegates to §3.17 `import.import_batch` lifecycle; the pack supplies the AVA normalization tool for asset-row → `asset` + `asset_meter` extraction.

**WF-20: key_revocation_on_termination** (per marquee #35)
- Automation rule on `users.status='terminated'` event: for every open `key_assignment` for that user, emit `unrecovered_key_flag` + create recovery WO. Security Officer notified. States on `unrecovered_key_flag`: `created → recovery_in_progress → recovered | escalated_to_lock_change`.

#### 14.1.3 Automation rules (~25)

| 22 | `scheduled every 10min` | `dispatch_assignment.eta_at < now() - 30min` AND status NOT IN final states | Notify dispatcher of stale assignment | rule |
| 23 | `before save key_assignment` | `key_record.status != 'available'` | Block save with `KEY_NOT_AVAILABLE` | rule |
| 24 | `workflow on capital_replacement_request approved` | — | Persist multi-day approval state; checkpoint each transition | workflow |
| 25 | `workflow on vendor_invoice in discrepancy_flagged` | — | Human-review queue with reason-code routing | workflow |

#### 14.1.4 Views (~50)

Views are pack-namespaced; canon §7 (SOFTEN) collapses to customer-namespaced + role views. Maintenance-core ships:

- **Per-collection default views (51)**: `<collection>_default_grid` — flat grid with the 6-8 most relevant columns; one per collection.
- **Role-tuned views (32)**: 
  - Technician: `my_open_work_orders`, `nearby_assets`, `my_inventory_holdings`, `my_pending_signatures`, `today_rounds`
  - Dispatcher: `unassigned_queue`, `in_progress_map`, `sla_breach_warning`, `vendor_dispatched_queue`
  - Maintenance Manager: `pm_compliance_dashboard`, `mttr_by_asset_class`, `mtbf_trend`, `vendor_scorecard_grid`, `contract_renewal_board`, `capital_replacement_pipeline`, `replacement_urgency_ranked`
  - Biomed Engineer: `clinical_devices_due_for_calibration`, `recall_response_open`
  - Facilities Manager: (handled in §14.3 overlay)
  - Compliance Officer: `signature_chain_browser`, `permit_to_work_active`, `recall_response_audit_trail`, `key_custody_ledger`, `unrecovered_keys_open`
  - FCA Inspector: `fca_open_assessments`, `deficiency_log_by_severity`
- **Cross-cutting views (~12)**: `assets_by_criticality`, `assets_by_location`, `assets_due_pm_30d`, `assets_warranty_expiring_60d`, `procurement_open`, `invoice_open_discrepancies`, `parts_below_reorder`, `inventory_aging`, `dispatch_today`, `dispatch_tomorrow`, `mobile_inventory_reconciliation_due`, `pending_advisories`

All views are validator-checked at pack publish for column code resolution (canon §7 + §13.8 G8.4 mobile-primitive eligibility on sync-eligible views).

#### 14.1.5 Workspaces (9 OOTB, all UI-Builder-authored)

Per canon §27, every workspace is authored via the same UI Builder customers use — eat-our-own-dog-food proof.

| Workspace | Page composition | Primitives used | Surface |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ws_technician_mobile_first` | 4 pages: Home / Work / Rounds / Assets. Home = `<TodayBriefing>` + `<MyOpenWorkOrders>` grid; Work = `<TriageDeck>` swipe through `<MaintenanceWorkOrderCard>`; Rounds = `<RoundsRunner>` glove-mode swipe-deck; Assets = barcode scanner → `<AssetDetail>` + `<AssetPinsCard>` | foundation + capture (`BarcodeScanner`, `NameplateCamera`) + field-tool primitives | mobile-first |
| `ws_dispatcher` | 2 pages: Sprint Board (drag-to-assign Kanban using `<SprintBoard>` + `<DispatchMap>`) / Vendor Dispatch (entitlement-intercept queue) | foundation + `<PivotKanban>` + `<DispatchMap>` | web |
| `ws_maintenance_manager` | 3 pages: KPI Dash (`<AssetUtilizationChart>`, `<PredictiveFailureHeatmap>`) / Replacement Board (`<ReplacementUrgencyScore>`, `<CapitalReplacementCard>`) / Contracts (`<ContractRenewalBoard>`, `<VendorScorecard>`) | foundation + Chart | web |
| `ws_biomed_engineer` | (Clinical overlay-aware; declared in maintenance-core, populated by clinical-maintenance overlay) | foundation + UDI primitives (overlay) | web |
| `ws_facilities_manager` | (Facilities overlay-aware) | (overlay) | web |
| `ws_compliance_officer` | 4 pages: Readiness Dashboard (compliance score per area) / Audit Trail (signature chain browser) / E-Signature Ledger (all signatures + Merkle batches) / Kiosk Sessions (issue + revoke per §3.11) | foundation + signature-chain viewer | web |
| `ws_fca_inspector` | 2 pages: Mobile FCA Capture (`<FloorPlanOverlay>` + finding-pin tap-to-create) / Deficiency Log | foundation + `<FloorPlanOverlay>` | mobile-first |
| `ws_auditor_kiosk` | 1 read-only page: `<AuditorKioskShell>` (binds to §3.11 kiosk session; renders the assigned workspace's surface in read-only mode) | foundation only — no actions | tablet |
| `ws_ot_security_officer` | (OT-security overlay-aware; declared here, populated by §14.4) | (overlay) | web |

All workspaces consume `task_projection` (§3.2) for queue surfaces; canon §13.8 G8.4 enforces mobile-primitive eligibility on mobile surfaces.

#### 14.1.6 Plugin components (32 React + RN via `@hubblewave/maintenance-plugins`)

### 14.2 `clinical-maintenance` overlay (~8 PRs)

Healthcare-vertical overlay on top of maintenance-core. Every collection added here justified by **PHI implication, FDA/UDI/ECRI vocabulary, or non-portable evidence schema** — clinical assets are NOT just maintenance-core assets with a different label, they carry regulatory data that has no place in the general pack.

This overlay POPULATES the `ws_biomed_engineer` workspace declared by maintenance-core in §14.1.5. Pack manifest declares the overlay's dependency on `maintenance-core@>=2026.05` and refuses install if maintenance-core is not present at the required version.

#### 14.2.1 Collections (12 total)

| Collection | Taskable | Sync→Mobile | Vector | Key properties | Substrate / PHI posture |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `aem_program` | — | ✓ full | — | `id`, `code`, `label`, `justification_document_id`, `committee_membership_user_ids[]`, `effective_from`, `effective_until`, `is_active`, `pm_modification_kind` (extended_interval/skipped_pm/reduced_scope) | FDA AEM requires documented committee; no PHI |
| `aem_program_membership` | ✓ regulated | — | — | `id`, `aem_program_id`, `asset_id`, `clinical_device_class_id`, `risk_assessment_score`, `decision_signature_chain_id`, `effective_from`, `effective_until`, `status` ∈ {proposed, committee_review, approved, rejected, retired} | §3.1; §3.6 closure signature with `signature_meaning='responsibility'` |

**Calibration + sterilization + PHI disposal (3 collections):**

| Collection | Taskable | Sync→Mobile | Vector | Key properties | Substrate / PHI posture |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `calibration_certificate` | — regulated | ✓ assigned_only | — | `id`, `inspection_id`, `asset_id`, `udi_record_id`, `cert_number`, `calibrated_at`, `expires_at`, `traceability_chain_jsonb` (NIST traceability path back to primary standard), `pdf_evidence_artifact_id`, `signature_chain_id` | §3.6 signature; §3.12 evidence_artifact for PDF; non-portable schema — clinical-specific |
| `sterilization_cycle` | ✓ regulated | ✓ assigned_only | — | `id`, `asset_id` (the autoclave/sterilizer), `cycle_number`, `started_at`, `completed_at`, `cycle_kind` (steam/eo/peroxide_plasma), `temperature_peak`, `pressure_peak`, `bi_test_result` (biological indicator: passed/failed/pending), `loaded_instrument_set_ids[]`, `signature_chain_id`, `status` | §3.1; §3.5 observation_streams (temperature/pressure rolled up); §3.6 verification signature |
| `phi_disposal_record` | ✓ regulated | — | — | `id`, `asset_id` (the device decommissioned), `disposal_method` (degauss/shred/wipe_to_nist_800_88/destroy), `disposal_date`, `witness_user_id`, `chain_of_custody_jsonb`, `signature_chain_id`, `nist_compliance_attested` (bool), `status` | §3.1; §3.6 closure with `signature_meaning='responsibility'`; **never stores PHI itself — records the destruction of PHI-bearing media** |

**EHR linkage + clinical criticality (3 collections):**

| Collection | Taskable | Sync→Mobile | Vector | Key properties | Substrate / PHI posture |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ehr_context_link` | — | — | — | `id`, `asset_id`, `ehr_system` (epic/cerner/meditech), `ehr_record_kind` (encounter_id/order_id/patient_id_hash), `ehr_ref` (encrypted token, NEVER raw patient identifier), `linked_at`, `linked_by_user_id`, `revoked_at` | **Read-only resolver; the ehr_ref column is KMS-encrypted; the property is `break_glass_eligible=false` AND `confidentiality_class='unrelated_patient_context'` (hard-deny)** — even Break-Glass cannot unmask. The linkage exists to navigate to the EHR system via a deep link, NOT to display PHI in HubbleWave. |
| `life_support_designation` | — | ✓ full | — | `id`, `asset_id`, `designation_kind` (life_support/critical_care/general_clinical), `joint_commission_category`, `effective_from`, `effective_until`, `last_review_date`, `next_review_due` | No PHI; drives §28 evaluator for asset-criticality-aware authz |

**Total: 12 collections.** All `signature_chain_id` references resolve to `compliance.signature_chains` per §3.6 (cross-pack reference to platform substrate is encouraged).

**PHI handling rules (hard-coded into pack validator at install time):**
- NO `clinical_maintenance` collection has a column flagged `confidentiality_class IN ('public', 'internal', 'sensitive')` while ALSO storing patient identifiers. Patient identifiers (when needed for navigation) are encrypted handles in `ehr_context_link.ehr_ref` only.
- `phi_disposal_record` is the inverse — it records that PHI WAS destroyed, never stores the destroyed PHI itself.
- §3.10 break-glass override is EXPLICITLY DISABLED on `ehr_context_link.ehr_ref` via `confidentiality_class='unrelated_patient_context'` (hard-deny class).

#### 14.2.2 Workflows (3 state machines)

**WF-OC1: aem_committee_review** (on `aem_program_membership`)
```
proposed → risk_assessed → committee_review → approved
                        → committee_review → rejected
                        → approved → re-evaluation_due → committee_review → approved | rejected | retired
```
Roles: `biomed_engineer` proposes; `biomed_committee` (group) reviews; `compliance_officer` records final signature. Guards:
- Transition `proposed → risk_assessed` requires `risk_assessment_score` populated AND `aem_program.justification_document_id` resolves to an active document.
- Transition `committee_review → approved` requires §3.6 signature with `signature_meaning='responsibility'` from any user holding `biomed_committee` role.
- Audit: every transition logs the committee membership snapshot at decision time.

**WF-OC2: phi_safe_disposal** (on `phi_disposal_record`)
```
asset_marked_for_disposal → custody_assigned → media_isolated → disposal_method_applied → witness_attested → certified → archived
                                                                                        → witness_rejected → re-isolate
```
Roles: `compliance_officer` initiates; `it_security_officer` performs disposal; `witness_user_id` (third party, must differ from disposer) attests. Guards:
- Transition `disposal_method_applied → witness_attested` requires §3.6 closure signature with `signature_meaning='responsibility'` AND `witness_user_id ≠ disposer_user_id` (separation of duties).
- `nist_compliance_attested=true` is REQUIRED to enter `certified` for any device with `clinical_criticality_score > 70`.

**WF-OC3: ecri_advisory_response** (on `recall_response` from maintenance-core, but specialized for ECRI source)
```
ecri_advisory_received → asset_query_run → affected_assets_identified → priority_assigned → remediation_in_progress → verified → closed
                                                                                          → no_action_required (false positive) → closed
```
Roles: AVA performs asset_query_run (via §3.14 vector + §3.15 graph for asset-cohort identification); `biomed_engineer` triages; `compliance_officer` verifies closure with §3.6 signature. Guards:
- `affected_assets_identified` requires §3.14 confidence ≥ 0.85 OR human-confirmed match.
- `verified` requires evidence_artifact per affected asset (e.g., firmware patch verification photo / vendor letter / replacement disposition).

#### 14.2.3 Automation rules (~6)

| # | Trigger | Condition | Action | Mode |
|---:|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `after save ecri_recall` | source=ecri AND severity ∈ {critical, high} | Run AVA asset-query (semantic + graph) against UDI corpus; create `recall_response` rows for matched assets; notify biomed_engineer | rule |
| 2 | `after save calibration_certificate` | — | Update parent `inspection.outcome='calibrated'`; schedule next calibration at `expires_at - 30 days` | rule |
| 3 | `scheduled daily` | `calibration_certificate.expires_at - 30 days = today` | Notify biomed_engineer + auto-generate PM for next calibration | rule |
| 4 | `before save aem_program_membership` | status='approved' AND signature_chain_id IS NULL | Block save with `AEM_APPROVAL_REQUIRES_SIGNATURE` | rule |
| 5 | `after save sterilization_cycle` | bi_test_result='failed' | Quarantine all `loaded_instrument_set_ids[]` (status='quarantined') + create reactive WO for sterilization investigation | rule |
| 6 | `before save phi_disposal_record` | status='certified' AND witness_user_id = disposer_user_id | Block save with `SEPARATION_OF_DUTIES_VIOLATION` | rule |

#### 14.2.4 Views

Adds clinical-specific views to the biomed engineer persona:
- `clinical_devices_due_for_calibration_30d` (overrides maintenance-core's generic version with UDI + class color-coding)
- `aem_program_membership_open` (committee review queue)
- `ecri_advisory_inbox` (severity-ranked)
- `phi_disposal_queue` (devices flagged for decommission with attached PHI media)
- `sterilization_cycles_today` (autoclave dashboard)
- `clinical_recall_response_audit_trail` (cross-references with maintenance-core's recall_response)
- `udi_lookup_grid` (FDA-formatted columns)
- `life_support_assets_review_due` (Joint Commission compliance)

8 clinical views + the biomed engineer role inherits all relevant maintenance-core views.

#### 14.2.5 Workspace population

This overlay populates `ws_biomed_engineer` (declared in §14.1.5 by maintenance-core). Page composition (4 pages):

### 14.3 `facilities-maintenance` overlay (~10 PRs)

Facilities-vertical overlay on top of maintenance-core. Adds **building-system management, regulatory compliance for facilities, space + seat + move management, and invisible-occupancy aggregate analytics**. Like clinical-maintenance, this overlay populates a workspace declared by maintenance-core (`ws_facilities_manager`).

Distinctive design call: facilities collections lean heavily on **§3.15 spatial+relationship graph** (room/corridor/floor relationships, asset-to-space binding) and **§3.5 observation streams** (occupancy beacons aggregated to 5-minute buckets per room, never per-individual — privacy preservation is binding).

#### 14.3.1 Collections (14 total)

All in `schema: 'facilities_maintenance'`.

**Building systems + regulatory infrastructure (4 collections):**

| Collection | Taskable | Sync→Mobile | Vector | Key properties | Substrate / regulatory posture |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `building_system` | — | ✓ assigned_only | ✓ name + description | `id`, `code`, `system_kind` ∈ {hvac, electrical, plumbing, fire_life_safety, vertical_transport, security}, `location_id`, `parent_system_id`, `criticality`, `owner_user_id`, `commissioning_date`, `status` | §3.15 graph for sub-system traversal; binds to maintenance-core `asset` via FK |
| `refrigerant_inventory` | — | — | — | `id`, `building_system_id`, `refrigerant_kind` (R-410A/R-134a/R-22/etc.), `gwp_value`, `quantity_lbs`, `last_inventoried_at`, `epa_phase_out_status` | EPA Section 608 reporting requirement |

| `building_compliance_certificate` | — regulated | — | — | `id`, `location_id`, `cert_kind` ∈ {fire_inspection, elevator_inspection, boiler_inspection, certificate_of_occupancy, energy_star, leed}, `issuing_authority`, `issued_at`, `expires_at`, `pdf_evidence_artifact_id`, `next_renewal_due` | §3.12 evidence_artifact for PDF; expiry triggers renewal workflow |

**FCA (Facility Condition Assessment) + CAD/BIM links (4 collections):**

| Collection | Taskable | Sync→Mobile | Vector | Key properties | Substrate / posture |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `fca_assessment` | ✓ | ✓ assigned_only | — | `id`, `location_id`, `inspector_user_id`, `scheduled_at`, `completed_at`, `methodology` (uniformat_ii/format/custom), `findings_count`, `status` | §3.1 |
| `fca_finding` | ✓ | ✓ assigned_only | ✓ description | `id`, `fca_assessment_id`, `system_kind`, `severity` ∈ {acceptable, fair, poor, critical}, `replacement_cost_estimate_cents`, `remaining_useful_life_years`, `location_3d` (within floor plan), `photo_evidence_attachment_ids[]`, `linked_capital_replacement_request_id`, `status` | §3.1; §3.12 photos; §3.14 vector |

| `ifc_space_link` | — | — | — | `id`, `space_id` (from maintenance-core), `ifc_file_evidence_artifact_id`, `ifc_global_id`, `ifc_class` (IfcSpace/IfcZone/IfcStorey), `imported_at` | §3.12 for BIM file; bridges maintenance-core `space` to BIM model |

**Energy + commissioning (2 collections):**

| Collection | Taskable | Sync→Mobile | Vector | Key properties | Substrate / posture |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `energy_baseline` | — | — | — | `id`, `location_id`, `baseline_period_start`, `baseline_period_end`, `kwh_per_sqft_per_year`, `gas_therms_per_sqft_per_year`, `weather_normalized` (bool), `methodology` (ashrae_14/iso_50006) | Drives §3.5 anomaly detection on energy meters |

**Space management (4 collections — marquees #21, #24, occupancy-aware ops):**

| Collection | Taskable | Sync→Mobile | Vector | Key properties | Substrate / posture |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `space_reservation` | ✓ | ✓ assigned_only | — | `id`, `space_id`, `requester_user_id`, `start_at`, `end_at`, `purpose` ∈ {meeting, maintenance_window, training, vendor_visit, event}, `status`, `conflict_resolution_id` | §3.1; cross-references §3.15 for adjacency-aware booking |
| `seat_assignment` | — | ✓ assigned_only | — | `id`, `space_id`, `occupant_user_id`, `assignment_kind` ∈ {permanent, hot_desk, temporary}, `valid_from`, `valid_until` | Drives §28 evaluator for "my seat" + "nearby colleagues" personalization |
| `move_request` | ✓ | ✓ assigned_only | — | `id`, `requester_user_id`, `from_space_id`, `to_space_id`, `asset_ids_to_move[]`, `assigned_team`, `scheduled_at`, `priority`, `status`, `approval_id` | §3.1; §3.15 for routing the move |
| `occupancy_log` | — | — | — | `space_id`, `observed_at`, `occupant_count`, `source` ∈ {badge_reader, sensor, manual_count, beacon_aggregate}, `confidence` | Partitioned monthly via pg_partman; **only aggregated bucket counts — NEVER per-individual occupancy** (privacy invariant codified in §3.18 G19.2 AST-scan equivalent — see §14.3.6) |

**Total: 14 collections.**

#### 14.3.2 Workflows (5 state machines)

**WF-OF1: fca_assessment_cycle** (on `fca_assessment`)
```
scheduled → in_progress → findings_logged → reviewed → approved
                                          → re-inspection_requested → in_progress
```
Roles: `fca_inspector` performs; `facilities_manager` reviews; `compliance_officer` approves with §3.6 signature. Guards:
- `findings_logged` requires at least one `fca_finding` row OR explicit "no findings" attestation via signature.
- `approved` requires all findings have either `status='resolved'` OR `linked_capital_replacement_request_id` populated (no orphan critical-severity findings).

**WF-OF2: refrigerant_leak_response** (on `refrigerant_log` where `event_kind='leak_detected'`)
```
detected → isolated → quantified → epa_form_drafted → epa_form_filed → repaired → re-charged → verified
                                                                                → exceeds_25pct_annual_loss → epa_violation_response_workflow
```
EPA Section 608 mandates reporting if annual loss exceeds 25% of refrigerant inventory for systems > 50 lb capacity. Roles: `epa_certified_technician` (auto-mapped to `service_contract` if vendor) performs; `facilities_manager` files EPA form; `compliance_officer` countersigns.
- Guard `epa_form_filed` requires `epa_form_filed_id` (links to §3.12 attachment of the form PDF).
- Cumulative annual loss tracked via materialized view across `refrigerant_log` entries; exceeding 25% triggers escalation branch.

**WF-OF3: commissioning_signoff** (on `commissioning_record`)
```
in_progress → cx_testing → punch_list_resolved → final_acceptance_review → signed_off → ongoing_monitoring
                                                                       → rejected → cx_testing
```
Closure requires §3.6 signature with `signature_meaning='approval'`. `ongoing_monitoring` is a terminal-but-active state used by retro-commissioning cycles.

**WF-OF4: move_request_approval** (on `move_request`)
```
proposed → originator_review → facility_manager_review → it_review → safety_review → scheduled → executed → closed
                                                                                  → rejected (any reviewer can reject) → originator_review
```
Multi-stage approval. Each stage may be skipped if no relevant assets (e.g., IT review skipped if `asset_ids_to_move[]` empty). Guards: `executed` requires linked WO with checklist completion; `closed` requires §3.6 closure signature.

**WF-OF5: space_reservation_conflict_resolution**
```
on save space_reservation: 
  check for overlapping reservations on same space_id with overlapping time window AND status ∈ {confirmed, in_progress}
  → no_conflict → confirmed
  → conflict_detected → priority_rule_applied → (incumbent_wins → declined) OR (new_wins → incumbent_canceled + alternate_suggested)
```
Priority rule (configurable per pack): `maintenance_window > event > training > vendor_visit > meeting`. AVA suggests alternate spaces (via §3.15 adjacency + capacity match) when conflicts arise.

#### 14.3.3 Automation rules (~7)

| # | Trigger | Condition | Action | Mode |
|---:|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `after save refrigerant_log` | cumulative annual loss > 25% for the system | Trigger WF-OF2 escalation branch; page-on-call to compliance_officer | rule |
| 2 | `scheduled daily` | `building_compliance_certificate.expires_at - 60 days = today` | Notify facilities_manager + create renewal WO | rule |
| 3 | `scheduled hourly` | `space_reservation.end_at < now()` AND status='in_progress' | Auto-transition to 'completed' | rule |
| 4 | `after save observation` | observation on energy meter; deviation > 20% from baseline | Emit anomaly to facilities_manager; if sustained > 4 hours, create reactive WO | rule |
| 5 | `before save move_request` | `to_space_id` has existing `seat_assignment` rows for a different `occupant_user_id` | Block save with `DESTINATION_SEAT_OCCUPIED` listing conflicts | rule |
| 6 | `before save occupancy_log` | `source != 'beacon_aggregate'` AND row count for `(space_id, observed_at_bucket)` > 1 | Aggregate by bucket; do NOT persist individual rows (privacy invariant) | rule |
| 7 | `scheduled daily 06:00` | — | Recompute `energy_baseline` rolling 12-month windows; flag drift for review | rule |

#### 14.3.4 Views

Adds 10 facilities-specific views populating the `ws_facilities_manager` workspace:
- `building_systems_by_criticality` (color-coded per system_kind)
- `fca_open_assessments` + `deficiency_log_by_severity` (extends maintenance-core's view)
- `refrigerant_leak_history_12mo` (chart with 25% threshold line)
- `compliance_certificates_expiring_60d`
- `energy_consumption_vs_baseline` (deviation chart)
- `commissioning_records_active` (incl. ongoing monitoring)
- `space_reservations_today` + `space_reservations_week_ahead`
- `move_requests_open` (Kanban by stage)
- `occupancy_heatmap_today` (room utilization aggregate)
- `building_compliance_score_card` (combined certificate + commissioning + FCA status)

#### 14.3.5 Workspace population

Populates `ws_facilities_manager` (declared in §14.1.5). 5 pages:

| Page | Composition | Primitives | Surface |
|---|---|---|---|
| Building Systems | `<FloorPlanOverlay>` overlay-kind='building_systems' + system tree + criticality chart | foundation + §3.15 | web |
| FCA + Deficiencies | `<FcaDeficiencyMap>` + deficiency severity Kanban + linked capital replacement requests | foundation | web |
| Refrigerant + Compliance | `<RefrigerantLedger>` + compliance certificate calendar + EPA filings | foundation + Chart | web |
| Energy + Commissioning | `<EnergyDashboard>` (baseline + actual + drift) + `<CommissioningTracker>` | foundation + Chart | web |
| Spaces + Moves + Occupancy | `<SpaceReservationCalendar>` + `<MoveRequestBoard>` + `<OccupancyHeatmap>` + `<LiveOperationalCanvas>` (per marquee #24) | foundation + §3.15 + §3.7 | web (Canvas needs WebGL) |

#### 14.3.6 Plugin components (7, in `@hubblewave/facilities-maintenance-plugins`)

| Component | Props | Surface | Substrate |
|---|---|---|---|
| `<RefrigerantLedger>` | `{ scope, range }` | web | foundation + Chart |
| `<FcaDeficiencyMap>` | `{ assessmentId, onFindingClick }` | web | §3.15 spatial + Card |
| `<EnergyDashboard>` | `{ locationId, range }` | web | §3.5 rollups + Chart |
| `<SpaceReservationCalendar>` | `{ scope, range, onSlotClick }` | web | foundation |
| `<MoveRequestBoard>` | `{ scope }` | web | task_projection |
| `<OccupancyHeatmap>` | `{ locationId, range, bucketMinutes }` | web | §3.5 (bucket-aggregated) |
| `<LiveOperationalCanvas>` | `{ locationId, layerSet }` | web (WebGL via Three.js / Mapbox GL) | §3.15 graph + task_projection + §3.5 streams; per marquee #24 |

**Privacy-aware data shaping in `<OccupancyHeatmap>`**: the component refuses to render data where the bucket count is < 3 (the k-anonymity threshold codified in canon §44 if §3.18 adopts it; for now this is a per-component refusal). Single-individual presence is NEVER inferable from rendered output.

| `bacnet-building-pack` | (superset of maintenance-core's `bacnet-generic`) `read_point`, `subscribe_cov`, `write_point`, `discover_devices`, `read_schedule`, `write_schedule` | `bacnet-building-fixtures-v1` (richer 60+ fixtures incl. schedules + trends) | Full BACnet building-stack integration; replaces `bacnet-generic` when this overlay installed |
| `autocad-dwg` | `parse_dwg`, `extract_layers`, `render_layer_image`, `find_room_boundaries` | `autocad-fixtures-v1` (8 sample DWG sets) | Imports CAD drawings into `cad_drawing_link`; AVA can resolve "room 3N-407" to coordinates |
| `ifc-bim` | `parse_ifc`, `extract_spaces`, `extract_systems`, `link_to_facility` | `ifc-fixtures-v1` (sample IFC4 buildings) | Imports BIM models; bridges to maintenance-core `space` |
| `wifi-beacon-occupancy` | `subscribe_beacon_events`, `aggregate_5min_buckets`, `enqueue_occupancy_log` | `wifi-beacon-fixtures-v1` | Wi-Fi controller + BLE + badge feed → bucket-aggregated occupancy; per marquee #24; NEVER persists per-individual events |

The `wifi-beacon-occupancy` adapter's privacy invariant is enforced at the adapter layer: it discards per-MAC-address events after aggregation; raw per-individual data never reaches `occupancy_log`. Pack-validator G18.4 (NEW for §14.3): adapter declaration must include `privacy_invariant: 'aggregate_only'` for occupancy data sources.

### 14.4 `ot-security-maintenance` overlay (~10 PRs) — Nuvolo OT Cyber Security parity

OT (Operational Technology) cyber-security overlay. Where clinical-maintenance and facilities-maintenance extend maintenance-core with regulatory and physical-domain data, ot-security extends it with **cyber-risk + network-policy + vulnerability lifecycle** data, plus the convergence point with maintenance via marquee #26 (AVA proposing attached-patch-step to an upcoming PM rather than scheduling separate vulnerability remediation).

This overlay POPULATES the `ws_ot_security_officer` workspace declared as the 9th OOTB workspace by maintenance-core. Hard requirement: install refuses if maintenance-core is not present; recommended pairing: `clinical-maintenance` (for medical-device-class signals) OR `facilities-maintenance` (for OT-in-building-systems signals).

The most security-critical aspect: the `nac-quarantine` adapter (§3.18) — flipping an OT device to network-isolated state has direct clinical-operations consequences. This pack consumes the canon §3.18 dual-confirmation NAC guardrails as a HARD dependency (install refuses if §3.18 not at the required version).

#### 14.4.1 Collections (6 total)

All in `schema: 'ot_security_maintenance'`.

| Collection | Taskable | Sync→Mobile | Vector | Key properties | Substrate / posture |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ot_asset_vulnerability` | ✓ | ✓ assigned_only | ✓ summary + cve_description | `id`, `asset_id` (FK to maintenance-core asset), `cve_id`, `cvss_score`, `exploitability` ∈ {none, theoretical, poc_available, exploited_in_wild}, `exposure` ∈ {internet_facing, internal_network, isolated_segment, air_gapped}, `summary`, `vendor_advisory_url`, `discovered_at`, `discovered_via` (adapter id), `mitigation_kind` ∈ {patch, config_change, network_isolation, compensating_control, accepted_risk}, `target_mitigation_at`, `mitigated_at`, `signature_chain_id`, `status` ∈ {open, triaging, mitigating, mitigated, accepted_risk, suppressed_false_positive} | §3.1; §3.14 vector for CVE search; §3.6 closure signature on mitigated; depends on maintenance-core asset |
| `network_policy` | — | — | — | `id`, `code`, `label`, `policy_kind` ∈ {allowlist, denylist, segmentation_rule, baseline}, `asset_id_set[]` (FK to maintenance-core asset), `ingress_rules` (jsonb: protocol/port/source CIDR), `egress_rules` (jsonb: protocol/port/dest), `last_audited_at`, `owner_user_id`, `is_active`, `signature_chain_id` (signed on creation + major edit) | §3.6 signature for policy edits — every change requires `signature_meaning='approval'` |
| `security_advisory` | — | ✓ assigned_only | ✓ summary + affected_asset_query | `id`, `source` ∈ {claroty, medigate, asimily, ecri, fda, manufacturer, internal}, `ref_id`, `affected_asset_query` (jsonb predicate evaluated by AVA via §3.14 vector + §3.15 graph), `severity`, `published_at`, `action_required`, `action_deadline`, `status` ∈ {ingested, distributed, acknowledged, acted, suppressed} | §3.14 vector for cross-source dedup |
| `discovery_event` | — | — | — | `id`, `source_adapter` ∈ {claroty, medigate, asimily, internal_nmap, manual}, `discovered_at`, `raw_payload` (jsonb), `mac_address_hash`, `ip_address_hash`, `firmware_signature`, `mapped_asset_id` (FK to maintenance-core asset), `status` ∈ {new, mapped, ignored, ambiguous} | MAC/IP hashed at adapter layer — never persist plaintext network identifiers |
| `risk_score` | — | ✓ assigned_only | — | `id`, `asset_id` (FK to maintenance-core asset), `computed_at`, `score` (0-100), `factors_jsonb` (`{ open_vuln_count_weighted_by_cvss, exposure_factor, clinical_criticality (from clinical-maintenance if present), patch_age_days_max, mitigating_controls_count, baseline_drift_severity }`), `computed_by_rule_set_version` | Cross-pack: reads `clinical_criticality_score` from clinical-maintenance when present; falls back to maintenance-core `criticality` when absent |
| `network_baseline` | — | — | — | `id`, `asset_id` (FK), `baseline_captured_at`, `allowed_traffic_pattern` (jsonb: protocols, port distribution, peer set), `baseline_validity_window_days`, `last_compared_at`, `drift_severity_at_last_compare` ∈ {within_baseline, minor_drift, significant_drift, anomalous} | Anomaly detection driver for WF-OT2 |

**Total: 6 collections.** The pack does NOT add asset-class collections — OT devices ARE maintenance-core `asset` rows with `asset_type` and additional ot-security relationship rows. This is the cleanest cross-pack integration: ot-security is purely about cyber-risk semantics over existing assets.

#### 14.4.2 Workflows (4 state machines)

**WF-OT1: vulnerability_response** (on `ot_asset_vulnerability`)
```
open → triaging → mitigation_plan_drafted → mitigation_approved → mitigating → mitigated → verified → closed
                                          → mitigation_rejected → triaging
                                          → accepted_risk (with signature + reason) → archived
                                          → suppressed_false_positive (with signature + reason) → archived
```
Roles: AVA performs initial triage (CVSS + exposure → risk score); `ot_security_officer` reviews; `compliance_officer` countersigns `accepted_risk` decisions. Guards:
- `mitigation_approved` requires §3.16 `transaction_approval` if mitigation cost > threshold OR `mitigation_kind='accepted_risk'`.
- `verified` requires evidence_artifact via §3.12 (e.g., post-patch nmap scan showing port closed; vendor confirmation).
- `accepted_risk` requires §3.6 signature with `signature_meaning='responsibility'` from ot_security_officer + countersign from compliance_officer.

**WF-OT2: network_anomaly_review** (on `network_baseline` drift detection)
```
within_baseline → minor_drift → reviewed_acceptable → continue_monitoring
                              → reviewed_requires_action → policy_update_or_quarantine
                → significant_drift → escalated_to_officer → policy_update_or_quarantine
                → anomalous → auto_alert + escalated_to_officer → quarantine_proposed → quarantine_executed (NAC dual-confirmation required)
```
Branch to NAC quarantine flows through §3.18 `KillswitchService.trip` with the dual-confirmation requirements; this overlay supplies the "is this asset clinically safe to quarantine right now" pre-check evidence (linking back to clinical-maintenance `life_support_designation` if present, falling back to maintenance-core `criticality_score`).

**WF-OT3: security_advisory_distribution** (on `security_advisory`)
```
ingested → asset_query_run (AVA via §3.14 + §3.15) → affected_assets_identified → notifications_sent → acknowledgements_collected → action_tracking → closed
                                                                                                                          → action_deadline_breached → escalated_to_officer
```
Distinguishes from clinical-maintenance's `WF-OC3 ecri_advisory_response` (ECRI-specific) by source diversity (Claroty/Medigate/Asimily/manufacturer). The pack-installer enforces dedup via §3.14 vector match against existing advisories.

**WF-OT4: ava_convergence_routing** (per marquee #26 — the differentiator)
```
ot_vulnerability_opened + upcoming_pm_for_same_asset_exists → ava_proposes_convergence → security_officer_reviews → approved → pm_modified_to_include_patch_step → vulnerability_marked_closed_as_merged
                                                                                                                → rejected → standard_WF-OT1_flow
                                                                                                                → modified (technician + scope edits) → approved + signed_off
```
AVA pattern matching: when an `ot_asset_vulnerability` opens with `mitigation_kind='patch'` AND the same asset has a `maintenance_work_order` scheduled within the next 14 days (configurable), AVA emits a `synthesizeConvergenceProposal` via §3.8 — a transient form rendering the merged plan. OT Security Officer one-taps approve → `pm_modified_to_include_patch_step` writes an additional checklist_item to the existing WO + the vulnerability ticket auto-closes with `mitigation_kind='converged_with_pm'`. The `signature_chains` records the convergence decision linking both records (vulnerability_id + work_order_id).

This is the structural payoff of having ot-security as an OVERLAY rather than a separate platform — convergence routing requires reading + writing across maintenance-core + ot-security collections in one transaction, which a separate platform couldn't do cleanly.

#### 14.4.3 Automation rules (~5)

| # | Trigger | Condition | Action | Mode |
|---:|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `after save discovery_event` | `mapped_asset_id IS NULL` AND firmware_signature matches existing asset | Auto-map; transition `status='mapped'` | rule |
| 2 | `after save ot_asset_vulnerability` | `mitigation_kind='patch'` AND asset has upcoming maintenance_work_order ≤ 14d | Enqueue WF-OT4 convergence proposal | rule |
| 3 | `scheduled hourly` | `network_baseline.last_compared_at + INTERVAL '1 hour' < now()` for any active baseline | Compare current traffic snapshot → update drift_severity_at_last_compare; if drift transition → trigger WF-OT2 | rule |
| 4 | `before save network_policy` | active=true AND signature_chain_id IS NULL | Block save with `NETWORK_POLICY_REQUIRES_SIGNATURE` | rule |
| 5 | `after save security_advisory` | severity='critical' AND action_deadline < now() + 24h | Page on-call OT security officer | rule |

#### 14.4.4 Views

8 OT-security views populating `ws_ot_security_officer`:
- `vulnerabilities_open_by_cvss` (sorted by CVSS desc, exposure desc)
- `vulnerabilities_action_deadline_30d` (overdue board)
- `network_policies_active` (with signature audit trail)
- `network_baseline_drift_today`
- `advisories_inbox_by_source` (Claroty/Medigate/Asimily/manufacturer columns)
- `risk_scores_by_asset_grid` (sortable + filterable by criticality intersection)
- `convergence_proposals_pending` (WF-OT4 queue)
- `quarantined_assets_active` (the NAC-isolated set; cross-references safety-check evidence)

#### 14.4.5 Workspace population

Populates `ws_ot_security_officer` (declared in §14.1.5). 4 pages:

| Page | Composition | Primitives | Surface |
|---|---|---|---|
| Risk Map | `<OtAssetRiskMap>` (risk-colored floorplan) + risk_score sortable grid | foundation + §3.15 | web |
| Vulnerability Triage | `<VulnerabilityTracker>` per-asset CVE board with remediation timeline | foundation + Card | web |
| Network Baselines | `<NetworkBaselineDashboard>` (deviation visualization per asset) + active policy list | foundation + Chart | web |
| Convergence + Advisories | WF-OT4 proposal queue + advisory inbox per source | foundation | web |

#### 14.4.6 Plugin components (3, in `@hubblewave/ot-security-maintenance-plugins`)

| Component | Props | Surface | Substrate |
|---|---|---|---|
| `<OtAssetRiskMap>` | `{ locationId, scoringMode }` | web | §3.15 spatial + Chart for color scale |
| `<VulnerabilityTracker>` | `{ assetId? OR scope }` | web | task_projection + signature chain reader |
| `<NetworkBaselineDashboard>` | `{ assetId? OR scope, range }` | web | §3.5 observation_streams + Chart |

#### 14.4.7 Integration adapters (5)

| Adapter | Operations | Conformance fixtures | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `claroty-medical-device-security` | `pull_devices`, `pull_vulnerabilities`, `subscribe_advisory_events` | `claroty-fixtures-v1` | Primary medical-device-security feed |
| `medigate-asset-feed` | `pull_assets`, `pull_vulnerabilities`, `subscribe_baseline_drift` | `medigate-fixtures-v1` | Alternative asset + vuln feed |
| `asimily-vulnerability-feed` | `pull_vulnerabilities`, `risk_score_explain` | `asimily-fixtures-v1` | Vulnerability + risk feed |
| `generic-cmdb-export` | `push_asset_inventory`, `push_vuln_mitigation_status` | `cmdb-export-fixtures-v1` | Outbound push to customer-owned CMDB (ServiceNow CMDB, BMC Helix, etc.) — gives security teams cross-platform visibility |
| `nac-quarantine` | `quarantine_asset`, `release_quarantine`, `query_status` | `nac-fixtures-v1` | **Dual-confirmation HARD requirement per §3.18** — wraps Cisco ISE / Aruba ClearPass / Forescout / Fortinet etc. Every quarantine call goes through §3.18 KillswitchService NAC dual-confirmation flow |

All five adapters declare egress allowlist entries (§3.18 G19.1) — `nac-quarantine` is the only one with `dual_confirmation_required=true` flagged in pack manifest per §3.18 G19.3.

The `generic-cmdb-export` adapter is "outbound only" — it pushes data to a customer-owned CMDB but does NOT accept inbound writes. This is by design to avoid the "two sources of truth" trap: HubbleWave is THE source for assets it tracks; CMDB integration is a one-way mirror.

#### 14.4.8 PR breakdown for ot-security-maintenance (~10 PRs)

| PR | Goal | Files / scope | Acceptance |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 1 | Overlay pack scaffold + dependency on maintenance-core + §3.18 minimum version + `ot_asset_vulnerability` table + WF-OT1 | `packs/ot-security-maintenance/manifest.yaml`; schema + first migration + entity; workflow definition | Pack refuses install when maintenance-core or §3.18 NAC guardrails absent; vulnerability lifecycle workflow round-trips with §3.1 + §3.6 |
| 2 | `network_policy` + auto rule 4 (signature enforcement on save) + signature audit trail | Network policy collection + entity + automation rule | Policy edits require §3.6 signature; auto rule 4 blocks unsigned saves |
| 3 | `security_advisory` + WF-OT3 distribution + §3.14 dedup at install | Security advisory + workflow + AVA tool registration | Advisories ingest from multiple sources; dedup via §3.14 vector |
| 4 | `discovery_event` + auto rule 1 firmware-signature mapping + Claroty + Medigate adapters (live + simulator) | Discovery event collection + 2 adapter packages | Discovery events from both adapters map to existing maintenance-core assets |
| 5 | `risk_score` + cross-pack reading of clinical_criticality_score (when clinical-maintenance present) + score recomputation worker | Risk score collection + worker + view | Risk scores include clinical criticality when overlay present; fall back to maintenance-core criticality otherwise |
| 6 | `network_baseline` + WF-OT2 + auto rule 3 (hourly comparison) | Baseline collection + workflow + scheduled rule | Baseline drift detected; minor/significant/anomalous transitions trigger appropriate response |
| 7 | Asimily adapter + `generic-cmdb-export` adapter (outbound-only with one-way mirror invariant) | 2 adapter packages with conformance fixtures | Both adapters pass conformance; CMDB export pushes asset inventory without accepting inbound writes |
| 8 | `nac-quarantine` adapter integration with §3.18 dual-confirmation + safety-check evidence linkage (clinical_criticality > 70 OR life_support_designation present → block without dual approval + safety evidence) | Adapter package; §3.18 NAC guardrails consumer | Quarantine ALWAYS requires dual confirmation; clinical-criticality-aware refusals when guardrails missing |
| 9 | WF-OT4 ava_convergence_routing per marquee #26 + AVA tool registration + auto rule 2 (14d horizon) + `<VulnerabilityTracker>` plugin | Workflow + AVA tool + plugin | Convergence proposal fires when patch + upcoming PM coincide; one-tap approve merges; signature_chain records both records |
| 10 | `<OtAssetRiskMap>` + `<NetworkBaselineDashboard>` plugins + `ws_ot_security_officer` 4-page population + canon §44 amendment | UI Builder pages + 2 plugins + CLAUDE.md amendment | Risk map renders with score color-coding; baseline drift visualized; canon merged |

**Total: 10 PRs for ot-security-maintenance overlay. Estimated effort: ~20-24 working days.**

**Pack composition complete: 4 of 4 pack specs landed (§14.1 maintenance-core, §14.2 clinical-maintenance, §14.3 facilities-maintenance, §14.4 ot-security-maintenance).** Total pack PR scope: ~53 PRs across the four packs, layered on top of the ~103 substrate PRs from §13's worked examples. Remaining Phase 4 design: 30 workflow state machines (detail dives beyond the pack-level summaries above) + 35 marquee end-to-end specs.

## 15. Workflow State-Machine Deep Dives

§14's pack specs gave 1-paragraph summaries per workflow. §15 expands each into the implementation-ready form: full state diagram, per-transition table (from/to/trigger/guard/actor role/side effect/audit event), edge cases, and the fixture path that proves the state machine. **30 workflows total: 18 maintenance-core (§15.1) + 3 clinical (§15.2) + 5 facilities (§15.3) + 4 OT-security (§15.4).**

Each transition row in the per-workflow tables uses a uniform vocabulary:

- **Trigger** — `system_event:<event>` (e.g. `system_event:scheduled_tick`); `user_action:<action>`; `pack_rule:<rule_id>`; `workflow_complete:<other_wf>`.
- **Guard** — predicate evaluated atomically with the transition; failure rejects with structured error code.
- **Actor role** — the role required to invoke a user-action trigger; system events have actor `system`.
- **Side effect** — the deterministic write performed in the same DB transaction as the state flip.
- **Audit event** — the `audit_logs.event_kind` emitted via `withAudit(...)` (§3.6).

Edge-case bullets cover at minimum: timeout/expiry, concurrent transition contention, partial-failure rollback, and re-entry idempotency. Test fixture paths name the JSON fixtures every implementing PR MUST land alongside the workflow code.

### 15.1 maintenance-core workflows (18 state machines)

#### 15.1.1 WF-1 WO intake/triage (on `maintenance_work_order`)

**Diagram:**
```
draft ── submit ──> submitted ── triage ──> triaged ── assign ──> assigned ── start ──> in_progress
                                                                                │
                                                                                ├── block ──> blocked ── resume ──> in_progress
                                                                                └── complete ──> completed
        ┌── reject (from any pre-in_progress state) ──> rejected
        └── divert (from triaged) ──> entitlement_intercept (→ WF-2)
```

**Transitions:**
| From | To | Trigger | Guard | Actor | Side effect | Audit event |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| draft | submitted | `user_action:submit` | required fields present | `requester` | task_projection refresh | `wo.submitted` |
| submitted | triaged | `user_action:triage` | `priority` set | `dispatcher` | — | `wo.triaged` |
| triaged | assigned | `user_action:assign` | technician has required skills | `dispatcher` | notify technician | `wo.assigned` |
| triaged | entitlement_intercept | `pack_rule:entitlement_match` | active `service_contract` covers asset+failure | `system` | divert to WF-2 | `wo.diverted_to_vendor` |
| triaged | rejected | `user_action:reject` | reason_code set | `dispatcher`/`maintenance_manager` | — | `wo.rejected` |
| assigned | in_progress | `user_action:start` | technician at asset site OR remote-eligible | `assigned_technician` | start SLA timer | `wo.started` |
| in_progress | blocked | `user_action:block` | block reason set | `assigned_technician` | pause SLA timer; alert dispatcher | `wo.blocked` |
| blocked | in_progress | `user_action:resume` | block reason resolved | `assigned_technician`/`dispatcher` | resume SLA timer | `wo.resumed` |
| in_progress | completed | `user_action:complete` | checklist 100% AND closure signature (§3.6) | `assigned_technician` | stop SLA timer; trigger WF-12 | `wo.completed` |

**Edge cases:**
- SLA expiry while `blocked`: timer remains paused; WF-11 escalation does NOT fire until back in `in_progress`.
- Concurrent assign attempts on same WO: row-level lock on `task_projection` row; second writer gets 409 with `WO_ALREADY_ASSIGNED`.
- Re-entry: idempotency on `wo_number` — duplicate submits with same client UUID return existing row.
- Cancellation post-assignment: must transition through `blocked` first; direct cancel from `in_progress` rejected.

**Fixtures:** `apps/api/test/fixtures/workflows/wf-1-wo-intake-triage.json` (8 happy-path + 6 edge-case scenarios).

#### 15.1.2 WF-2 WO triage with entitlement intercept (marquee #23 extension of WF-1)

**Diagram:**
```
entitlement_intercept ── ava_resolve ──> entitlement_proposed ── approve ──> vendor_dispatched ── vendor_complete ──> vendor_completed ── close_out ──> human_close_out (→ WF-12)
                                       │
                                       └── reject ──> back to WF-1 assigned (internal tech path)
```

**Transitions:**
| From | To | Trigger | Guard | Actor | Side effect | Audit event |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| entitlement_intercept | entitlement_proposed | `system_event:ava_contract_match` | §3.14 confidence ≥ 0.85 AND service_contract active | `system` | persist `ava_proposal_id` | `entitlement.proposed` |
| entitlement_proposed | vendor_dispatched | `user_action:approve_dispatch` | vendor reachable per recent health check | `dispatcher` | dispatch via vendor API/email | `entitlement.dispatched` |
| entitlement_proposed | back_to_internal | `user_action:reject_proposal` | rejection reason set | `dispatcher` | transition WO to WF-1 `assigned` | `entitlement.rejected_to_internal` |
| vendor_dispatched | vendor_completed | `system_event:vendor_callback` OR `user_action:mark_vendor_done` | vendor signature OR signed proof attached | `system`/`dispatcher` | attach evidence_artifact | `vendor.work_completed` |
| vendor_completed | human_close_out | `user_action:close` | invoice received OR vendor PO closed | `maintenance_manager` | transition to WF-12 | `wo.entitlement_closed` |

**Edge cases:**
- AVA confidence drift: if §3.14 confidence falls below 0.85 between propose and approve (re-evaluation), require fresh approval.
- Vendor unreachable: 3 retry attempts at 4h intervals; then auto-divert back to internal via `reject_proposal`.
- Vendor invoice arrives before vendor_callback: WF-17 invoice reconciliation runs independently; this workflow does NOT block on invoice.

**Fixtures:** `apps/api/test/fixtures/workflows/wf-2-entitlement-intercept.json`.

| awaiting_approval | approved | `workflow_complete:transaction_approval[approved]` | TransactionApproval.status='approved' (§3.16) | `system` | resume WF-1 in_progress | `wo.approval_granted` |
| awaiting_approval | rejected | `workflow_complete:transaction_approval[rejected]` | status='rejected' | `system` | notify requester | `wo.approval_denied` |
| awaiting_approval | expired | `system_event:scheduled_tick + expires_at past` | now() > expires_at AND status='pending' | `system` | mark transaction_approval expired | `wo.approval_expired` |

**Edge cases:**
- Re-submit after rejection: creates a NEW TransactionApproval; the original audit chain preserves the rejection forever.
- Approval expires while WO still in `awaiting_approval`: cascades cancel back to WO via system event.
- Amount changes after approval requested but before decided: requires withdraw + resubmit (§3.16 `withdraw`).

#### 15.1.4 WF-4 PM generation orchestration (on `pm_schedule`)

**Diagram:**
```
pending ── due_check ──> due_now ── generate ──> wo_generated ── observation_settled ──> completed
        └── premature ──> skip
        generation_failed ──> retry (max 3) ──> wo_generated  OR  ──> failed_permanent (anomaly emitted)
```

**Transitions:**
| From | To | Trigger | Guard | Actor | Side effect | Audit event |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| pending | due_now | `system_event:scheduled_tick` | `next_due_at <= now()` | `system` | — | `pm.due` |
| due_now | wo_generated | `system_event:generate` | NOT (`last_generated_at` within 1h of `next_due_at`) — idempotency | `system` | INSERT `maintenance_work_order`; update `last_generated_at` | `pm.wo_generated` |
| due_now | skip | `pack_rule:asset_in_maintenance_pause` | asset.status='maintenance_pause' | `system` | record skip; reschedule | `pm.skipped` |
| wo_generated | completed | `workflow_complete:wf-12[wo close-out]` | linked WO closed | `system` | reschedule `next_due_at` | `pm.cycle_completed` |
| due_now | generation_failed | `system_event:exception` | INSERT exception | `system` | log error | `pm.generation_error` |
| generation_failed | wo_generated | `system_event:retry` | retry_count < 3 | `system` | retry INSERT | `pm.retry_succeeded` |
| generation_failed | failed_permanent | `system_event:retry` | retry_count >= 3 | `system` | emit anomaly; page on-call | `pm.failed_permanent` |

**Edge cases:**
- Utilization-trigger PMs (mileage/runtime): idempotency uses `(pm_schedule_id, meter_reading_snapshot)` — same reading does not regenerate.
- Calendar-trigger overlap with utilization-trigger: whichever fires first; subsequent trigger within 1h is suppressed.
- Pack-policy `pm_skip_if_open_wo_for_asset`: when set, transition to `skip` if asset has open WO.

#### 15.1.5 WF-5 Calibration signoff (on `inspection` where `inspection_kind='calibration'`)

**Diagram:**
```
scheduled ──> in_progress ──> calibration_recorded ──> awaiting_signoff ──> signed_off ──> (cert valid until expiry)
                                                                       └── rejected_redo ──> in_progress
                                                                       expired (scheduled tick) ──> expired
```

**Transitions:**
| From | To | Trigger | Guard | Actor | Side effect | Audit event |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| scheduled | in_progress | `user_action:start` | technician on site | `biomed_engineer`/`calibration_tech` | — | `cal.started` |
| in_progress | calibration_recorded | `user_action:record_results` | measurement values within instrument range | `biomed_engineer` | INSERT `calibration_certificate` draft | `cal.recorded` |
| calibration_recorded | awaiting_signoff | `system_event:auto` | traceability_chain populated | `system` | — | `cal.ready_for_signoff` |
| awaiting_signoff | signed_off | `user_action:sign` | §3.6 fresh WebAuthn AND signature_meaning='verification' | `compliance_officer`/`biomed_committee` | finalize cert; attach §3.12 PDF | `cal.signed_off` |
| awaiting_signoff | rejected_redo | `user_action:reject` | rejection reason set | `compliance_officer` | clear draft; back to in_progress | `cal.signoff_rejected` |
| signed_off | expired | `system_event:scheduled_tick` | now() > expires_at | `system` | auto-trigger next calibration PM | `cal.expired` |

**Edge cases:**
- Multi-witness calibration (FDA Class III): requires 2 signatures with `witness_user_id ≠ signer_user_id` (separation pattern reused from §14.2 WF-OC2).
- Out-of-tolerance result: state stays in `calibration_recorded` but evaluator marks `requires_adjustment=true`; technician must re-record after adjustment.
- Asset out-of-service before signoff: transition to `aborted`; audit captures partial measurements.

**Fixtures:** `apps/api/test/fixtures/workflows/wf-5-calibration-signoff.json`.

#### 15.1.6 WF-6 Recall remediation (on `recall_response`)

**Diagram:**
```
pending ──> in_progress ──> remediated ──> verified ──> closed
                         └── no_action_required ──> closed
                         └── failed_remediation ──> escalated
```

**Transitions:**
| From | To | Trigger | Guard | Actor | Side effect | Audit event |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| pending | in_progress | `user_action:start_remediation` | recall_response.assigned_user_id set | `biomed_engineer`/`maintenance_tech` | — | `recall.started` |
| in_progress | remediated | `user_action:mark_remediated` | action_kind ∈ {patch, replace, decommission} executed + evidence attached | `biomed_engineer` | INSERT evidence_artifact | `recall.remediated` |
| remediated | verified | `user_action:verify` | §3.6 signature with `signature_meaning='verification'` | `compliance_officer` | finalize | `recall.verified` |

| verified / no_action / failed | closed | `user_action:close` | terminal state | `compliance_officer` | finalize record | `recall.closed` |

**Edge cases:**
- SLA based on advisory severity: critical=72h, high=7d, medium=30d. SLA breach in `in_progress` triggers anomaly + paging.
- Multi-asset advisory: one parent recall_response per advisory; one child per affected asset; parent closes only when ALL children verified.
- Vendor patch delay: extend SLA with documented reason; audit records extension.

**Fixtures:** `apps/api/test/fixtures/workflows/wf-6-recall-remediation.json`.

#### 15.1.7 WF-7 FCA review (lite — full version in §14.3 WF-OF1)

**Diagram:**
```
scheduled ──> in_progress ──> findings_logged ──> resolved
```

**Transitions:** simplified — single happy path; defers to §14.3 WF-OF1 when facilities-maintenance overlay installed.

| From | To | Trigger | Guard | Actor | Side effect | Audit event |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| scheduled | in_progress | `user_action:start` | inspector assigned | `fca_inspector` | — | `fca.started` |
| in_progress | findings_logged | `user_action:complete_inspection` | findings recorded OR no-findings attestation | `fca_inspector` | — | `fca.findings_logged` |
| findings_logged | resolved | `user_action:mark_resolved` | every finding has status=resolved OR linked CR request | `facilities_manager` | — | `fca.resolved` |

**Edge cases:** When `facilities-maintenance` overlay installs, this lite version is REPLACED by WF-OF1 (validator G14.2 enforces).

**Fixtures:** `apps/api/test/fixtures/workflows/wf-7-fca-lite.json`.

#### 15.1.8 WF-8 Permit-to-work authorization (on `permit_to_work`)

**Diagram:**
```
requested ──> hazard_assessed ──> authorized ──> loto_in_progress ──> work_in_progress ──> work_complete ──> loto_removed ──> closed
                                              └── rejected ──> closed
                                                                                                          loto_remove_blocked ──> escalated
```

**Transitions:**
| From | To | Trigger | Guard | Actor | Side effect | Audit event |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| requested | hazard_assessed | `user_action:assess_hazards` | hazard_class set | `safety_officer` | — | `permit.hazard_assessed` |
| hazard_assessed | authorized | `user_action:authorize` | §3.6 signature `signature_meaning='approval'`; valid_from/valid_until set | `safety_officer`/`maintenance_manager` | INSERT `signature_chains` row | `permit.authorized` |
| hazard_assessed | rejected | `user_action:reject` | reason_code set | `safety_officer` | — | `permit.rejected` |
| authorized | loto_in_progress | `user_action:begin_loto` | `valid_from <= now() <= valid_until` | `assigned_technician` | INSERT `loto_step_check` rows | `permit.loto_started` |
| loto_in_progress | work_in_progress | `user_action:loto_complete` | all `loto_step_check` rows verified + signed | `assigned_technician` | — | `permit.work_started` |
| work_in_progress | work_complete | `user_action:complete_work` | linked WO completed | `assigned_technician` | — | `permit.work_complete` |
| work_complete | loto_removed | `user_action:remove_loto` | all LOTO removals signed in reverse order | `assigned_technician` | — | `permit.loto_removed` |
| loto_removed | closed | `user_action:close` | §3.6 closure signature | `safety_officer` | finalize | `permit.closed` |
| loto_in_progress | loto_remove_blocked | `system_event:expiry` OR `user_action:emergency_stop` | hazard re-emerged | `safety_officer`/`system` | page emergency | `permit.loto_blocked` |

**Edge cases:**
- Permit expiry during `work_in_progress`: hard-stop work; require renewal sub-workflow; audit emergency-stop.
- LOTO step out-of-sequence: validator rejects (sequence enforced).
- Multiple technicians sharing permit: each must add their own LOTO step_check with their personal lock; permit closes only when all locks removed.

**Fixtures:** `apps/api/test/fixtures/workflows/wf-8-permit-to-work.json`.

#### 15.1.9 WF-9 Parts reorder

**Diagram:**
```
triggered ──> procurement_proposal_drafted ──> po_generated ──> received ──> stock_updated
            └── below_threshold_recovered ──> closed_no_action
```

**Transitions:**
| From | To | Trigger | Guard | Actor | Side effect | Audit event |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| triggered | procurement_proposal_drafted | `pack_rule:reorder_threshold_breach` | `parts_catalog.reorder_threshold` exceeded | `system` | INSERT `procurement_proposal` | `parts.reorder_triggered` |
| procurement_proposal_drafted | po_generated | `workflow_complete:wf-16[approved_to_po]` | proposal approved | `system` | INSERT `purchase_order` | `parts.po_generated` |
| po_generated | received | `system_event:receipt_logged` | receipt entry created | `system`/`receiving_clerk` | INSERT `stock_movement` (receive) | `parts.received` |
| received | stock_updated | `system_event:auto` | stock count incremented | `system` | refresh inventory views | `parts.stock_updated` |
| triggered | closed_no_action | `system_event:stock_replenished_externally` | on hand > threshold before proposal drafted | `system` | — | `parts.no_action` |

**Edge cases:**
- Concurrent reorder triggers (multiple meters cross threshold): debounce — one proposal per `(parts_catalog_id, 24h window)`.
- Vendor lead time exceeded: re-trigger with escalation flag → procurement_proposal with `urgency='high'`.
- Manual override (someone places PO outside automation): system detects existing PO covering the part and skips automation.

**Fixtures:** `apps/api/test/fixtures/workflows/wf-9-parts-reorder.json`.

#### 15.1.10 WF-10 AEM review (lite — full version in §14.2 WF-OC1)

Defers entirely to §14.2 WF-OC1 when clinical-maintenance overlay installed. Lite version supports legacy/industrial-equipment AEM-equivalent decisions (not clinical-regulated).

**Diagram:** `assessed → committee_review → outcome (membership_added | excluded | re_evaluate)`

**Fixtures:** `apps/api/test/fixtures/workflows/wf-10-aem-lite.json`.

#### 15.1.11 WF-11 WO escalation loop (background, on `maintenance_work_order`)

**Diagram:**
```
running ──> sla_warning (T-2h) ──> sla_breached (T+0) ──> escalated_to_manager ──> escalated_to_director (T+24h)
```

**Transitions:**
| From | To | Trigger | Guard | Actor | Side effect | Audit event |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| running | sla_warning | `system_event:scheduled_tick` | now() ≥ sla_due_at - 2h | `system` | notify assignee + manager | `wo.sla_warning` |
| sla_warning | sla_breached | `system_event:scheduled_tick` | now() ≥ sla_due_at | `system` | INSERT runtime_anomaly | `wo.sla_breached` |
| sla_breached | escalated_to_manager | `system_event:auto` | — | `system` | reassign visibility | `wo.escalated_manager` |
| escalated_to_manager | escalated_to_director | `system_event:scheduled_tick` | now() ≥ sla_due_at + 24h | `system` | page director | `wo.escalated_director` |

**Edge cases:**
- WO transitions to `blocked` during escalation: pause escalation timer (per WF-1 §15.1.1 edge case); resume on un-block.
- Multiple SLA breaches per WO lifecycle (block + resume cycle): each breach gets a fresh audit row.

**Fixtures:** `apps/api/test/fixtures/workflows/wf-11-escalation.json`.

---

#### 15.1.12 WF-12 WO close-out (on `maintenance_work_order`)

**Diagram:**
```
completed ──> review ──> closed_final
                       └── reopened ──> WF-1 in_progress
```

**Transitions:**
| From | To | Trigger | Guard | Actor | Side effect | Audit event |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| completed | review | `system_event:auto` | checklist 100% AND closure signature present | `system` | enqueue manager review | `wo.review_queued` |
| review | closed_final | `user_action:close` | cost reconciliation done AND parts_consumption recorded | `maintenance_manager` | finalize task_projection; mark cycle complete | `wo.closed_final` |
| review | reopened | `user_action:reopen` | reason_code set | `maintenance_manager`/`requester` | revert task_projection | `wo.reopened` |

**Edge cases:**
- Missing closure signature in `completed`: cannot reach `review` — WF-1 transition guards already enforce.
- Reopen-storm prevention: re-open count > 3 requires director approval.
- Parts not reconciled at close: gentle warning; close allowed; flag in monthly variance report.

**Fixtures:** `apps/api/test/fixtures/workflows/wf-12-close-out.json`.

#### 15.1.13 WF-13 round_completion_review (on `work_round_session`; marquee #25)

**Diagram:**
```

                                                                    └── reactive_wos_spawned
```

**Transitions:**
| From | To | Trigger | Guard | Actor | Side effect | Audit event |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| started | in_progress | `user_action:tap_first_asset` | technician assigned | `technician` | start §3.5 observation stream | `round.started` |
| in_progress | observations_streaming | `system_event:auto` | first observation recorded | `system` | — | `round.streaming` |
| observations_streaming | completed | `user_action:end_round` | all `round_definition.ordered_asset_ids[]` touched OR explicit "stopping early" reason | `technician` | finalize observations | `round.completed` |

| completed/reactive_wos_spawned | reviewed | `user_action:close_round` | manager review | `dispatcher`/`maintenance_manager` | — | `round.reviewed` |

**Edge cases:**
- Round abandoned (technician walks away): session times out after 4h idle; auto-transition to `completed` with `stopping_early_reason='timeout'`.
- Failed observations spawn duplicate WOs: dedup by `(asset_id, failure_kind, 24h window)`.
- Round NOT taskable: no `task_projection` row written for the session itself; only spawned WOs become tasks (§14.1.1 collection table).

**Fixtures:** `apps/api/test/fixtures/workflows/wf-13-rounds.json`.

#### 15.1.14 WF-14 contract_renewal_cycle (on `service_contract`)

**Diagram:**
```
active ──(T-90)──> t_90_notified ──(T-30)──> t_30_notified ──(T-7)──> t_7_notified ──(T+0)──> expired

```

**Transitions:**
| From | To | Trigger | Guard | Actor | Side effect | Audit event |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| active | t_90_notified | `pack_rule:auto_rule_7` | end_date - 90d = today | `system` | notify maintenance_manager + procurement_manager | `contract.t_90` |
| t_90_notified | t_30_notified | `pack_rule:auto_rule_8` | end_date - 30d = today | `system` | escalation notification | `contract.t_30` |
| t_30_notified | t_7_notified | `pack_rule:auto_rule_9` | end_date - 7d = today | `system` | page-on-call notification | `contract.t_7` |
| t_7_notified | expired | `system_event:scheduled_tick` | now() ≥ end_date | `system` | mark expired; trigger renewal procurement_proposal | `contract.expired` |
| any (active...t_7_notified) | active (new contract) | `user_action:renew` | new MSA/contract created via WF-16 | `procurement_manager` | link old → new contract | `contract.renewed` |

**Edge cases:**
- Auto-renewal flag (`auto_renewal=true`): on T+0, automatically extend by 1 year unless explicit cancellation queued.
- Renewal proposed but not approved before T+0: extend grace period 30d; if still unapproved, lapse to `expired` with `renewal_failed` flag.
- Mid-cycle modification (rate-card change): new MSA row links to existing contract; original retained for audit.

**Fixtures:** `apps/api/test/fixtures/workflows/wf-14-contract-renewal.json`.

#### 15.1.15 WF-15 capital_replacement_review (marquee #27, on `capital_replacement_request`)

**Diagram:**
```
proposed ──> director_review ──> approved ──> procurement_proposal_linked ──> asset_decommissioned

**Transitions:**
| From | To | Trigger | Guard | Actor | Side effect | Audit event |

| director_review | rejected | `workflow_complete:transaction_approval[rejected]` | rejection with reason | `director` | — | `capr.rejected` |
| approved | procurement_proposal_linked | `pack_rule:auto_rule_21` | — | `system` | INSERT `procurement_proposal` linking to this CR request | `capr.procurement_linked` |
| procurement_proposal_linked | asset_decommissioned | `workflow_complete:wf-16[approved_to_po]` AND `system_event:replacement_received` | new replacement asset commissioned + old asset marked decommissioned | `system` | flip `asset.status='decommissioned'`; cascade pm_asset_assignment deactivation | `capr.completed` |

**Edge cases:**
- Replacement not received within 90d of approval: trigger escalation + emit anomaly.
- Old asset has open WOs at decommission time: refuse decommission until WOs closed OR transferred to replacement.
- Multi-asset replacement (fleet replacement): single capr; multiple linked procurement_proposals; decommission cascade per item.

**Fixtures:** `apps/api/test/fixtures/workflows/wf-15-capital-replacement.json`.

| po_generated | closed | `system_event:po_received_or_closed` | linked PO reaches terminal state | `system` | — | `proc.closed` |

**Edge cases:**
- AVA confidence varies per line: lines below confidence threshold get visual cue requiring explicit per-line action; "approve all" still requires reviewer to acknowledge low-confidence lines.
- Vendor unavailable post-approval: line marked `vendor_unavailable_replanned`; reviewer re-routes to alternate vendor.
- Currency mismatch with cost center: validator catches at draft time.

| approved | paid | `system_event:payment_executed` | payment system callback | `system` | mark paid | `inv.paid` |

**Edge cases:**
- Multi-PO invoice (one invoice covering multiple POs): split invoice into per-PO three_way_match attempts; partial match permitted.
- Duplicate invoice number: dedup at `received` — second attempt returns existing row.
- Currency conversion: invoice in foreign currency; system converts to base; variance computed in base currency; tolerance applied in base.

| wo_generated | linked_pm_complete | `workflow_complete:wf-12` | linked WO closed | `system` | record meter snapshot for next idempotency | `fleet.cycle_complete` |

**Edge cases:**
- Mileage observation arrives during WO open for the same threshold: idempotency suppresses duplicate WO.
- Negative mileage delta (meter rollover): WF-4 PM generation rules handle; this workflow trusts §3.5 anomaly detection.
- OBD2 adapter feed interruption: gaps detected; fleet manager notified; PM cadence preserved by calendar fallback.

#### 15.1.19 WF-19 asset_import_commissioning (marquee #33) — delegates to §3.17 import_batch state machine

WF-19 is a thin pack-side wrapper around §3.17 `import_batch` (states: ingested → normalizing → reviewable → publishing → published | rolled_back | abandoned). The maintenance-core pack supplies the AVA normalization tool (`asset_csv_normalizer`) that maps source rows to `asset` + `asset_meter` writes. Refer to §13.18 PR-breakdown for the underlying primitive state machine; the pack adds:

- **Pack-specific guard**: `reviewable → publishing` requires every row's `ava_normalized_payload.asset_type_id` resolves to an existing seeded `asset_type` row (validator G14-asset-import). Unrecognized types fail the per-row check and the batch cannot publish until rows are accepted/rejected.
- **Pack-specific side effect**: on `publishing → published`, the pack writes BOTH `asset` rows AND `asset_meter` rows derived from the normalized payload's meter columns (mileage/runtime/etc.).

**Fixtures:** `apps/api/test/fixtures/workflows/wf-19-asset-import.json`.

#### 15.1.20 WF-20 key_revocation_on_termination (marquee #35)

**Diagram:**
```
hr_termination_event ──> open_key_assignments_enumerated ──> per_key: unrecovered_key_flag_created ──> per_key: recovery_wo_dispatched ──> per_key: recovered | per_key: escalated_to_lock_change
```

**Transitions (per `unrecovered_key_flag`):**
| From | To | Trigger | Guard | Actor | Side effect | Audit event |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| (NEW) | flag_created | `pack_rule:auto_rule_15` | `users.status → terminated` AND open key_assignment for user | `system` | INSERT `unrecovered_key_flag`; INSERT `recovery_wo` | `key.flag_created` |
| flag_created | recovery_in_progress | `user_action:dispatch_recovery` | recovery WO assigned | `security_officer` | — | `key.recovery_dispatched` |
| recovery_in_progress | recovered | `user_action:confirm_recovery` | key physically returned AND §3.6 signature | `security_officer` | `key_assignment.status='recovered'`; close recovery WO | `key.recovered` |
| recovery_in_progress | escalated_to_lock_change | `system_event:scheduled_tick` | now() > flag_created_at + policy.escalation_days (default 7) | `system` | trigger lock-change procurement workflow | `key.escalated` |

**Edge cases:**
- Master key unrecovered: cascade impact — every lock the master_key opens is flagged; bulk rekey procurement workflow auto-created.
- Recovery during escalation: cancel escalation, mark recovered, audit both events.
- Multiple keys held by terminated user: one flag per key; recovery handled in parallel; security_officer sees grouped view.
- False-positive termination (rehired): admin reverses `users.status='terminated'` within grace window → cascading flag retraction (with audit retention).

**Fixtures:** `apps/api/test/fixtures/workflows/wf-20-key-revocation.json`.

---

**§15.1 summary:** All 18 maintenance-core workflows specified with full state diagrams, per-transition tables (uniform vocabulary: trigger/guard/actor/side-effect/audit event), edge cases, and fixture paths. Every taskable transition that closes a record requires a §3.6 closure signature; every SLA-breach transition emits a runtime_anomaly + audit row; every cross-pack invocation (WF-15 → WF-16, WF-9 → WF-16, WF-17 → §3.16) uses `workflow_complete:<other_wf>` triggers for explicit cross-workflow coupling.

### 15.2 clinical-maintenance workflows (3 state machines)

#### 15.2.1 WF-OC1 aem_committee_review (on `aem_program_membership`)

**Diagram:**
```
proposed ──> risk_assessed ──> committee_review ──> approved ──> active ──> re_evaluation_due ──> committee_review ──> approved | rejected | retired
                                                 └── rejected ──> archived
                                                 └── deferred ──> risk_assessed (cycle back for more data)
```

**Transitions:**
| From | To | Trigger | Guard | Actor | Side effect | Audit event |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| proposed | risk_assessed | `user_action:assess` | `risk_assessment_score` populated AND `aem_program.justification_document_id` resolves to active doc | `biomed_engineer` | — | `aem.risk_assessed` |
| risk_assessed | committee_review | `user_action:submit_to_committee` | committee membership has quorum ≥ 3 | `biomed_engineer` | notify committee members | `aem.committee_review_started` |
| committee_review | approved | `user_action:approve` | §3.6 signature `signature_meaning='responsibility'` from a `biomed_committee` role-holder | `biomed_committee` | INSERT signature_chain row carrying committee membership snapshot | `aem.approved` |
| committee_review | rejected | `user_action:reject` | reason_code in `clinical_maintenance__aem_*` namespace | `biomed_committee` | — | `aem.rejected` |
| committee_review | deferred | `user_action:defer_for_more_data` | requested-data list set | `biomed_committee` | notify biomed_engineer | `aem.deferred` |
| approved | active | `system_event:auto` | effective_from ≤ now() | `system` | apply pm_modification_kind (extended_interval / skipped_pm / reduced_scope) to linked `pm_asset_assignment` | `aem.active` |
| active | re_evaluation_due | `system_event:scheduled_tick` | `effective_until - 30d ≤ today` | `system` | notify committee | `aem.re_eval_due` |
| any (active/re_eval) | retired | `user_action:retire` OR `system_event:effective_until_past` | reason set | `biomed_committee`/`system` | revert pm_asset_assignment to default cadence | `aem.retired` |

**Edge cases:**
- Committee quorum drops below 3 during review: state stays in `committee_review`; transition to `approved/rejected` blocked until quorum restored. Audit captures the gap.
- Signature replay verification: the snapshot of committee membership at decision time is captured in `signature_chains.payload` (leaf-tuple includes committee user_ids); membership change after the fact does not invalidate the historical decision per §3.7.5.1 snapshot pattern.
- Asset moved between AEM programs: requires explicit `retired` + new `proposed`; no implicit reassignment.
- AEM-affected asset has open WO using the modified pm cadence: WO is NOT auto-cancelled; runs to completion under the AEM-modified schedule.

**Fixtures:** `apps/api/test/fixtures/workflows/wf-oc1-aem-committee-review.json`.

#### 15.2.2 WF-OC2 phi_safe_disposal (on `phi_disposal_record`)

**Diagram:**
```
asset_marked_for_disposal ──> custody_assigned ──> media_isolated ──> disposal_method_applied ──> witness_attested ──> certified ──> archived
                                                                                                └── witness_rejected ──> re_isolate ──> disposal_method_applied
                                                                                                  emergency_destruction (override) ──> archived (with high-severity audit)
```

**Transitions:**
| From | To | Trigger | Guard | Actor | Side effect | Audit event |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| asset_marked_for_disposal | custody_assigned | `user_action:assign_custody` | disposer_user_id set | `compliance_officer` | — | `phi.custody_assigned` |
| custody_assigned | media_isolated | `user_action:isolate_media` | physical isolation confirmed; chain_of_custody_jsonb seeded | `it_security_officer` (disposer) | — | `phi.media_isolated` |
| media_isolated | disposal_method_applied | `user_action:apply_method` | disposal_method ∈ {degauss, shred, wipe_to_nist_800_88, destroy} AND method-appropriate for device kind | `it_security_officer` | append to chain_of_custody_jsonb | `phi.method_applied` |
| disposal_method_applied | witness_attested | `user_action:attest` | **separation of duties: `witness_user_id ≠ disposer_user_id`** AND §3.6 closure signature `signature_meaning='responsibility'` from witness | `witness` (third party) | INSERT signature_chain row | `phi.witness_attested` |
| disposal_method_applied | witness_rejected | `user_action:reject_attestation` | rejection reason set | `witness` | — | `phi.witness_rejected` |
| witness_rejected | re_isolate | `user_action:re_isolate` | reason addressed; new isolation evidence | `it_security_officer` | — | `phi.re_isolated` |
| re_isolate | disposal_method_applied | `user_action:reapply_method` | — | `it_security_officer` | — | `phi.method_reapplied` |
| witness_attested | certified | `user_action:certify` | for clinical_criticality_score > 70: `nist_compliance_attested = true` (REQUIRED) | `compliance_officer` | finalize record | `phi.certified` |
| any | archived | `user_action:archive` | terminal state | `compliance_officer` | move to archive partition | `phi.archived` |
| disposal_method_applied/witness_rejected | emergency_destruction | `user_action:emergency_override` | imminent-threat reason + dual signatures | `compliance_officer + ciso` | high-severity audit `phi.emergency_destruction` | `phi.emergency_destruction` |

**Edge cases:**
- Disposer attempts to self-attest (witness_user_id = disposer_user_id): auto rule 6 (§14.2.3) blocks save with `SEPARATION_OF_DUTIES_VIOLATION`.
- Chain-of-custody gap (timestamps non-monotonic in `chain_of_custody_jsonb`): validator flags at `media_isolated → disposal_method_applied` transition.
- Device has linked EHR context: requires `ehr_context_link.revoked_at` set BEFORE `media_isolated` (revocation precedes physical disposal); audit records the revocation timestamp.
- Multi-device batch disposal: one `phi_disposal_record` per device — no batch disposal allowed (audit clarity requirement).
- NIST 800-88 method choice for storage media: validator constrains `disposal_method` based on `asset_type.discriminator` (HDD → degauss or wipe_to_nist_800_88; SSD → destroy or wipe; paper records → shred).

**Fixtures:** `apps/api/test/fixtures/workflows/wf-oc2-phi-disposal.json`.

#### 15.2.3 WF-OC3 ecri_advisory_response (on `recall_response` with ECRI source)

**Diagram:**
```
ecri_advisory_received ──> asset_query_run ──> affected_assets_identified ──> priority_assigned ──> remediation_in_progress ──> verified ──> closed
                                            └── no_assets_affected ──> false_positive ──> closed
                                            └── ambiguous_match ──> human_triage ──> affected_assets_identified | false_positive
```

**Transitions:**
| From | To | Trigger | Guard | Actor | Side effect | Audit event |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ecri_advisory_received | asset_query_run | `pack_rule:auto_rule_1_clinical` | severity ∈ {critical, high} | `system` | invoke AVA asset-cohort tool (§3.14 + §3.15) | `ecri.advisory_received` |
| asset_query_run | affected_assets_identified | `system_event:auto` | §3.14 match confidence ≥ 0.85 for at least one asset | `system` | INSERT child `recall_response` per matched asset | `ecri.assets_identified` |
| asset_query_run | no_assets_affected | `system_event:auto` | 0 matches above confidence threshold | `system` | mark advisory_response as resolved | `ecri.no_match` |
| asset_query_run | ambiguous_match | `system_event:auto` | matches in 0.7-0.85 confidence band | `system` | enqueue human triage | `ecri.ambiguous` |
| ambiguous_match | affected_assets_identified | `user_action:confirm_matches` | biomed selects subset of candidates | `biomed_engineer` | INSERT child responses for confirmed only | `ecri.human_confirmed` |
| ambiguous_match | false_positive | `user_action:dismiss` | dismissal reason set | `biomed_engineer` | — | `ecri.dismissed` |
| affected_assets_identified | priority_assigned | `system_event:auto` | severity → SLA mapping applied to each child | `system` | each child gets `recall_response.target_completion_date` | `ecri.prioritized` |
| priority_assigned | remediation_in_progress | `user_action:start_remediation` | resource assigned | `biomed_engineer` | — | `ecri.remediation_started` |
| remediation_in_progress | verified | `user_action:verify_all_children` | every child `recall_response.status='verified'` (per WF-6) | `compliance_officer` | — | `ecri.verified` |
| verified / false_positive / no_assets_affected | closed | `user_action:close` | terminal | `compliance_officer` | finalize | `ecri.closed` |

**Edge cases:**
- AVA confidence per child varies: a parent verification requires every child INDIVIDUALLY verified — no batch verify.
- Late-arriving asset (newly commissioned device that matches existing closed advisory): pack scheduled job runs daily re-match against still-active advisories; matched newly-commissioned assets spawn new child responses without reopening the parent.
- Cross-pack interaction: when `ot-security-maintenance` is installed, ECRI advisories that are ALSO cyber-vulnerabilities (e.g., medical device with CVE) ALSO trigger `ot_asset_vulnerability` row creation via cross-pack hook; WF-OT4 convergence routing may then propose merging with upcoming PMs.
- Manufacturer disputes (recall claim withdrawn): parent transitions to `false_positive` after compliance review; children cascading-cancel.

**Fixtures:** `apps/api/test/fixtures/workflows/wf-oc3-ecri-advisory.json`.

---

**§15.2 summary:** 3 clinical-maintenance workflows specified. WF-OC1 introduces the committee-membership-snapshot pattern (committee user_ids captured in signature_chain.payload at decision time — same pattern as §3.7.5.1 e-signature snapshots). WF-OC2 enforces separation of duties at the data-model level (witness ≠ disposer is a CHECK constraint) AND adds emergency_destruction with dual signatures for imminent-threat scenarios. WF-OC3 cross-references §3.14 vector + §3.15 graph for asset-cohort identification with explicit confidence bands (high ≥ 0.85 auto, medium 0.7-0.85 human triage, low < 0.7 no-action).

### 15.3 facilities-maintenance workflows (5 state machines)

#### 15.3.1 WF-OF1 fca_assessment_cycle (on `fca_assessment`)

**Diagram:**
```
scheduled ──> in_progress ──> findings_logged ──> reviewed ──> approved ──> archived
                                               └── re_inspection_requested ──> in_progress
                                               └── critical_findings_open ──> blocked (cannot transition to reviewed)
```

**Transitions:**
| From | To | Trigger | Guard | Actor | Side effect | Audit event |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| scheduled | in_progress | `user_action:start_inspection` | inspector at site OR remote-eligible inspection | `fca_inspector` | — | `fca.started` |
| in_progress | findings_logged | `user_action:complete_inspection` | at least one `fca_finding` row OR explicit "no findings" attestation via §3.6 signature | `fca_inspector` | — | `fca.findings_logged` |
| findings_logged | reviewed | `user_action:request_review` | findings reviewed by inspector for completeness | `fca_inspector` | enqueue for facilities_manager | `fca.review_requested` |
| reviewed | approved | `user_action:approve` | **all findings have `status='resolved'` OR `linked_capital_replacement_request_id` set** AND §3.6 signature `signature_meaning='approval'` | `compliance_officer` | finalize assessment | `fca.approved` |
| reviewed | re_inspection_requested | `user_action:request_reinspection` | rejection reason set | `facilities_manager`/`compliance_officer` | clear reviewed timestamp | `fca.reinspection_requested` |
| reviewed | critical_findings_open | `system_event:auto` | any `severity='critical'` finding with status NOT resolved AND no linked CR | `system` | block approval | `fca.critical_blocking` |
| approved | archived | `system_event:scheduled_tick` | archive_after_days reached (default 365) | `system` | move to archive partition | `fca.archived` |

**Edge cases:**
- Re-inspection cycles: same `fca_assessment.id` is reused (state transitions back); inspection count tracked via `assessment_iterations[]` JSONB.
- Finding promoted to critical post-inspection: `findings_logged → reviewed` transition re-evaluates `critical_findings_open` guard; approval blocked retroactively if a finding's severity is escalated.
- Cross-pack with maintenance-core: every `fca_finding` with `severity ∈ {poor, critical}` MUST link to `capital_replacement_request_id` (the WF-15 trigger). Validator catches missing links at `findings_logged → reviewed`.
- Multi-system FCA (one assessment covering hvac + electrical + plumbing): single assessment row; findings tagged by `system_kind`; approval rolls up all systems.

**Fixtures:** `apps/api/test/fixtures/workflows/wf-of1-fca-assessment.json`.

#### 15.3.2 WF-OF2 refrigerant_leak_response (on `refrigerant_log` where `event_kind='leak_detected'`)

**Diagram:**
```
detected ──> isolated ──> quantified ──> epa_form_drafted ──> epa_form_filed ──> repaired ──> re_charged ──> verified
                                                                              └── exceeds_25pct_annual_loss ──> epa_violation_response_workflow

```

**Transitions:**
| From | To | Trigger | Guard | Actor | Side effect | Audit event |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| detected | isolated | `user_action:isolate_system` | technician EPA Section 608 certified | `epa_certified_technician` | mark building_system status='isolated' | `refr.isolated` |
| isolated | quantified | `user_action:record_loss` | `quantity_change_lbs` measured | `epa_certified_technician` | update `refrigerant_inventory.quantity_lbs` | `refr.quantified` |

| quantified | (skip to repaired) | `system_event:auto` | annual loss = 0 OR system size ≤ 50 lb (EPA threshold) | `system` | bypass EPA path | `refr.below_epa_threshold` |
| epa_form_drafted | epa_form_filed | `user_action:file_form` | EPA form PDF attached via §3.12; `technician_certification_number` populated | `facilities_manager` | §3.12 attachment + `epa_form_filed_id` linked | `refr.epa_filed` |
| epa_form_filed | repaired | `user_action:complete_repair` | repair WO (linked) completed | `epa_certified_technician` | — | `refr.repaired` |
| repaired | re_charged | `user_action:record_recharge` | `quantity_change_lbs` (positive, refill amount) recorded | `epa_certified_technician` | update `refrigerant_inventory.quantity_lbs` | `refr.recharged` |
| re_charged | verified | `user_action:verify_no_leak` | post-repair leak test passed (evidence attached) | `compliance_officer` | §3.6 closure signature | `refr.verified` |
| any (post-quantified) | exceeds_25pct_annual_loss | `pack_rule:auto_rule_1_facilities` | cumulative annual loss > 25% of inventory | `system` | page compliance_officer; enqueue EPA-violation sub-workflow | `refr.violation_threshold` |
| isolated | repair_deferred | `user_action:defer_repair` | deferral reason set (e.g. parts on order); target_repair_date set | `facilities_manager` | hold state | `refr.deferred` |
| repair_deferred | isolated | `system_event:scheduled_tick` | target_repair_date past OR parts available | `system` | resume | `refr.repair_resumed` |

**Edge cases:**
- 25% threshold crossed mid-flow: WF-OF2 continues normally but flagged with violation; EPA reporting escalates to mandatory CAA Section 608 enforcement form.
- Multiple leaks in same system within fiscal year: cumulative tracking via materialized view; ANY transition that pushes cumulative > 25% triggers the violation branch.
- Non-EPA refrigerant (HFO with very low GWP): pack policy can bypass EPA path; but `refrigerant_log` row still required for inventory tracking.
- Repair contractor (vendor) performs work: external-collaborator session (§3.11) used; signature_chain captures contractor's certification number for audit.

**Fixtures:** `apps/api/test/fixtures/workflows/wf-of2-refrigerant-leak.json`.

#### 15.3.3 WF-OF3 commissioning_signoff (on `commissioning_record`)

**Diagram:**
```
in_progress ──> cx_testing ──> punch_list_resolved ──> final_acceptance_review ──> signed_off ──> ongoing_monitoring (terminal-but-active)
                                                                                └── rejected ──> cx_testing (cycle)
```

**Transitions:**
| From | To | Trigger | Guard | Actor | Side effect | Audit event |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| in_progress | cx_testing | `user_action:begin_testing` | system installed; commissioning_authority assigned | `commissioning_agent` | — | `cx.testing_started` |
| cx_testing | punch_list_resolved | `user_action:close_punch_items` | every punch-list item has `status='resolved'` OR `accepted_with_qualification` | `commissioning_agent` | — | `cx.punch_resolved` |
| punch_list_resolved | final_acceptance_review | `user_action:request_acceptance` | — | `commissioning_agent` | enqueue for facilities_manager + owner | `cx.acceptance_requested` |
| final_acceptance_review | signed_off | `user_action:sign_off` | §3.6 signature `signature_meaning='approval'` from facilities_manager AND from project_owner (dual signature for major systems) | `facilities_manager + project_owner` | begin warranty period if linked | `cx.signed_off` |
| final_acceptance_review | rejected | `user_action:reject` | rejection reason set | `facilities_manager`/`project_owner` | back to cx_testing | `cx.rejected` |
| signed_off | ongoing_monitoring | `system_event:auto` | `commissioning_kind ∈ {ongoing, monitoring_based}` | `system` | recurring cx check enqueued | `cx.monitoring_started` |

**Edge cases:**
- Retro-commissioning (existing system): skip in_progress; start at cx_testing with baseline assessment.
- Punch-list item rejected by owner during final_acceptance_review: state cycles back to cx_testing for that item; the rest of the system can proceed if all critical items pass.
- Dual signature requirement: major systems (HVAC plant, electrical service, fire suppression) require both facilities_manager AND project_owner signatures; smaller systems (single AHU) require only facilities_manager.
- Ongoing_monitoring termination: when ongoing_monitoring runs longer than `commissioning_record.monitoring_until`, auto-transition to `archived` after final report generation.

**Fixtures:** `apps/api/test/fixtures/workflows/wf-of3-commissioning.json`.

#### 15.3.4 WF-OF4 move_request_approval (on `move_request`)

**Diagram:**
```
proposed ──> originator_review ──> facility_manager_review ──> it_review ──> safety_review ──> scheduled ──> executed ──> closed
            └── rejected (any reviewer can reject) ──> originator_review (revise)

**Transitions:**
| From | To | Trigger | Guard | Actor | Side effect | Audit event |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| proposed | originator_review | `system_event:auto` | request submitted with required fields | `system` | — | `move.proposed` |
| originator_review | facility_manager_review | `user_action:submit_for_review` | from/to spaces exist; assets_to_move resolved | `requester` | — | `move.facility_review_started` |
| facility_manager_review | it_review | `user_action:approve` | space capacity sufficient; no conflicting move_requests overlap | `facilities_manager` | — | `move.facility_approved` |
| facility_manager_review | rejected | `user_action:reject` | reason set | `facilities_manager` | back to originator_review | `move.facility_rejected` |
| it_review | safety_review | `user_action:approve` OR `user_action:skip_if_no_assets` | when `asset_ids_to_move[]` non-empty: IT approval required; otherwise auto-skip | `it_manager`/`system` | — | `move.it_approved` |
| it_review | rejected | `user_action:reject` | reason set | `it_manager` | back to originator_review | `move.it_rejected` |
| safety_review | scheduled | `user_action:approve` OR `user_action:skip_if_no_hazards` | when assets include hazardous-class items: safety review required; otherwise auto-skip | `safety_officer`/`system` | INSERT linked WO with checklist | `move.scheduled` |
| safety_review | rejected | `user_action:reject` | reason set | `safety_officer` | back to originator_review | `move.safety_rejected` |

| any (proposed/originator_review) | withdrawn | `user_action:withdraw` | actor = requester | `requester` | — | `move.withdrawn` |

**Edge cases:**
- Skip-if-empty logic: IT review auto-skipped when no assets to move; safety review auto-skipped when no hazardous-class assets. Audit records skips with explicit `skipped_reason`.
- Reviewer reassignment mid-flow: original reviewer unavailable → manager reassigns; audit captures both the original assignee and the reassignment.
- Destination occupied: auto rule 5 (§14.3.3) blocks save at `proposed` if `to_space_id` has existing `seat_assignment` rows for different occupants — request must clear destination first.
- Concurrent move requests targeting same destination: priority rule (§14.3.2 WF-OF5 pattern) applied; later request gets `conflict_detected` flag during facility_manager_review.

**Fixtures:** `apps/api/test/fixtures/workflows/wf-of4-move-request.json`.

| conflict_check | no_conflict | `system_event:auto` | zero overlaps | `system` | — | `res.no_conflict` |
| no_conflict | confirmed | `system_event:auto` | — | `system` | task_projection refresh | `res.confirmed` |
| conflict_check | conflict_detected | `system_event:auto` | at least one overlap with status ∈ {confirmed, in_progress} | `system` | — | `res.conflict_detected` |

| priority_rule_applied | incumbent_wins | `system_event:auto` | incumbent_priority ≥ new_priority | `system` | reject new reservation with alternate suggestions | `res.incumbent_wins` |
| priority_rule_applied | new_wins | `system_event:auto` | new_priority > incumbent_priority | `system` | cancel incumbent reservation; confirm new; notify incumbent with AVA-suggested alternates (§3.15 adjacency + capacity) | `res.new_wins` |
| confirmed | in_progress | `system_event:scheduled_tick` | now() ≥ start_at | `system` | — | `res.in_progress` |
| in_progress | completed | `system_event:scheduled_tick` | now() ≥ end_at (auto rule 3, §14.3.3) | `system` | release space | `res.completed` |

**Edge cases:**
- Recurring reservation (RRULE): each occurrence runs conflict check independently; one canceled occurrence does not cancel the series.
- Pack-policy priority rule customization: default priority `maintenance_window > event > training > vendor_visit > meeting`; customer may override via pack manifest.
- AVA alternate suggestions: when `new_wins` cancels an incumbent, AVA proposes 3 alternate spaces using §3.15 floor adjacency + space capacity match within the original time window; suggestion attached to the cancellation notification.
- Simultaneous-priority conflict (same priority): first-to-confirm wins; subsequent are declined with alternates.
- Long-running maintenance window blocking many small meetings: pack-policy can configure soft-priority rules (e.g. "maintenance_window can be moved if 5+ meetings would be displaced") with multi-stage review.

**Fixtures:** `apps/api/test/fixtures/workflows/wf-of5-reservation-conflict.json`.

**§15.3 summary:** 5 facilities-maintenance workflows specified. WF-OF1 cross-references maintenance-core's WF-15 capital replacement (every severe finding MUST link to a capital_replacement_request_id — validator-enforced). WF-OF2 codifies EPA Section 608 reporting flow including the 25% annual loss escalation branch that fires from ANY post-quantification transition. WF-OF3 introduces dual-signature requirement for major systems + the `ongoing_monitoring` terminal-but-active state for retro-commissioning. WF-OF4 demonstrates the skip-if-empty pattern for multi-stage reviews (IT review auto-skipped when no assets; safety skipped when no hazards). WF-OF5 is the only workflow that runs INSIDE the save hook (conflict_check transition happens before the row is committed) — uses pack-policy priority rules + AVA alternate suggestions for conflict resolution.

```

**Transitions:**
| From | To | Trigger | Guard | Actor | Side effect | Audit event |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| open | triaging | `system_event:auto` OR `user_action:claim` | AVA initial triage runs (CVSS + exposure → risk score); claimed by officer | `system`/`ot_security_officer` | compute risk_score row | `vuln.triaging` |
| triaging | mitigation_plan_drafted | `user_action:draft_mitigation` | `mitigation_kind` set ∈ {patch, config_change, network_isolation, compensating_control, accepted_risk} | `ot_security_officer` | — | `vuln.plan_drafted` |
| mitigation_plan_drafted | mitigation_approved | `workflow_complete:transaction_approval[approved]` OR `user_action:approve_no_cost` | §3.16 transaction_approval if mitigation cost > threshold; for accepted_risk: §3.6 signature `signature_meaning='responsibility'` from ot_security_officer + countersign from compliance_officer | `ot_security_officer + compliance_officer` | record approval evidence | `vuln.approved` |
| mitigation_plan_drafted | mitigation_rejected | `user_action:reject_plan` | reason set | `ot_security_officer`/`compliance_officer` | back to triaging | `vuln.plan_rejected` |
| mitigation_approved | mitigating | `user_action:start_mitigation` | linked WO opened for mitigation work | `assigned_technician` | — | `vuln.mitigating` |
| mitigating | mitigated | `user_action:mark_mitigated` | mitigation work completed; evidence_artifact attached (e.g., post-patch nmap scan showing port closed; vendor confirmation; config diff) | `assigned_technician` | INSERT §3.12 evidence_artifact | `vuln.mitigated` |
| mitigated | verified | `user_action:verify` | §3.6 closure signature `signature_meaning='verification'` from ot_security_officer; evidence_artifact reviewed | `ot_security_officer` | finalize | `vuln.verified` |
| verified | closed | `user_action:close` | terminal | `ot_security_officer` | — | `vuln.closed` |
| any (pre-mitigated) | accepted_risk | `user_action:accept_risk` | dual signature (ot_security_officer + compliance_officer); business justification documented | `ot_security_officer + compliance_officer` | high-severity audit | `vuln.accepted_risk` |
| any (pre-mitigated) | suppressed_false_positive | `user_action:suppress` | signature + reason set | `ot_security_officer` | — | `vuln.false_positive` |
| any (pre-mitigated) | superseded_by_convergence | `workflow_complete:wf-ot4[approved]` | WF-OT4 convergence approved AND vulnerability merged into PM | `system` | link convergence_chain_entry_id; close as merged | `vuln.converged` |

**Edge cases:**
- CVSS score updates (NVD revises CVSS): `risk_score` recomputes; if score crosses severity threshold, vulnerability stays in current state but visibility alert fires.
- Compensating control becomes ineffective: re-open path via `mitigated → verified → re-open` (special re-open transition with audit); reusable for "we patched but a new exploit bypasses".
- Multi-asset vulnerability (same CVE on N assets): one ot_asset_vulnerability row per (asset_id, cve_id) pair; parent grouping via `vulnerability_cohort_id` for batch mitigation tracking.
- Accepted_risk re-evaluation: scheduled review every 90d; if still accepted, dual-signature renewal; if no signature within 14d of review_due, escalate to compliance_officer.

**Edge cases:**
- Clinical-critical asset auto_quarantine: REFUSED — `clinical_criticality_score ≥ 70` OR `life_support_designation` present forces manual dual-confirmation; never auto-quarantine clinical-critical regardless of attack-signature match.
- Quarantine bypass without dual-confirmation: §3.18 G19.3 validator catches at install if pack manifest doesn't declare `dual_confirmation_required=true` for nac-quarantine adapter.
- Baseline drift cause is legitimate config change: ot_security_officer should `policy_update` to update baseline to new expected traffic pattern; failure to do so causes recurring `anomalous` alarms on that asset.
- Quarantine release: separate workflow (not part of WF-OT2) handles asset restoration; release also requires dual-confirmation per §3.18 symmetry.

#### 15.4.3 WF-OT3 security_advisory_distribution (on `security_advisory`)

```

**Transitions:**
| From | To | Trigger | Guard | Actor | Side effect | Audit event |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ingested | asset_query_run | `system_event:auto` | dedup check: §3.14 vector similarity to existing advisories < 0.95 (not a duplicate) | `system` | invoke AVA asset-cohort tool (§3.14 + §3.15) | `adv.query_started` |
| ingested | duplicate_suppressed | `system_event:auto` | dedup found ≥ 0.95 similar advisory | `system` | link to existing advisory; audit dedup decision | `adv.duplicate` |
| asset_query_run | affected_assets_identified | `system_event:auto` | matches above confidence threshold | `system` | — | `adv.affected_identified` |
| asset_query_run | no_assets_affected | `system_event:auto` | zero matches | `system` | mark resolved | `adv.no_match` |
| affected_assets_identified | notifications_sent | `system_event:auto` | per-asset owners resolved | `system` | dispatch notifications via per-asset owner role | `adv.notified` |
| notifications_sent | acknowledgements_collected | `user_action:acknowledge` (multiple) | each affected_asset's owner acks | `asset_owner` | — | `adv.acked` |

| action_tracking | action_deadline_breached | `pack_rule:auto_rule_5_ot_security` | `action_deadline < now()` AND not all linked actions closed | `system` | page on-call ot_security_officer | `adv.deadline_breached` |

**Edge cases:**
- Multi-source dedup: same CVE may arrive from Claroty + Medigate + Asimily — §3.14 vector dedup recognizes; one advisory row, links the multi-source references.
- Owner acknowledgement timeout: if `acknowledgements_collected` doesn't reach 100% within deadline, fallback to ot_security_officer who triages on behalf of unresponsive owners.
- Advisory withdrawn by source: transition to `superseded` terminal state; existing actions remain valid but no new action required.
- Cross-pack with clinical: when advisory targets medical devices, parallel WF-OC3 ecri_advisory_response also fires; the two workflows share `affected_asset_id` set but track independently.

#### 15.4.4 WF-OT4 ava_convergence_routing (marquee #26 — the differentiator)

```

**Transitions:**
| From | To | Trigger | Guard | Actor | Side effect | Audit event |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| (NEW from WF-OT1 triaging) | ava_proposes_convergence | `pack_rule:auto_rule_2_ot_security` | `ot_asset_vulnerability.mitigation_kind='patch'` AND same asset has `maintenance_work_order` scheduled within next 14 days (configurable) | `system` | invoke §3.8 AVA synthesizeConvergenceProposal — emits transient FormDefinition showing merged plan; INSERT `ava_proposals` row | `conv.proposed` |
| ava_proposes_convergence | security_officer_reviews | `system_event:auto` | AVA confidence ≥ 0.75 (lower bar than other AVA flows because human approval is the gate) | `system` | enqueue for ot_security_officer | `conv.review_started` |
| security_officer_reviews | approved | `user_action:approve` | §3.6 signature `signature_meaning='approval'` | `ot_security_officer` | — | `conv.approved` |
| security_officer_reviews | approved_with_modifications | `user_action:approve_with_edits` | scope edits applied (e.g. "patch + verify port" instead of just "patch"); §3.6 signature | `ot_security_officer` | record edits | `conv.modified_approval` |
| security_officer_reviews | rejected | `user_action:reject` | reason set | `ot_security_officer` | revert to WF-OT1 standard flow | `conv.rejected` |
| approved / approved_with_modifications | pm_modified_to_include_patch_step | `system_event:auto` | — | `system` | **CROSS-PACK WRITE**: write additional `checklist_item` to existing `checklist_instance` on the linked maintenance-core WO; record convergence_chain_entry_id linking BOTH ot_asset_vulnerability AND maintenance_work_order in ONE signature_chain row | `conv.pm_modified` |
| pm_modified_to_include_patch_step | vulnerability_marked_closed_as_merged | `system_event:auto` | — | `system` | transition WF-OT1 vulnerability state to `superseded_by_convergence` | `conv.vuln_merged` |

**Edge cases:**
- Multiple upcoming PMs for the same asset within horizon: AVA picks the EARLIEST one for convergence; if technician availability differs across candidates, AVA's confidence score reflects assignment compatibility.
- 14d horizon configurable per pack policy: customer with bi-weekly PM cadence may extend to 28d; customer with daily PM may shorten to 7d.
- Convergence rejected, but later the vulnerability deadline approaches: WF-OT1 standard flow handles; the rejection audit is preserved for review.
- Cross-pack signature_chains row: §15.4.4 is the ONLY workflow producing a single signature_chains row referencing BOTH a vulnerability_id AND a work_order_id — this is what makes "convergence" auditable as a single architectural decision, not a paired hack.
- AVA tool failure (synthesize call errors): fallback to WF-OT1 standard flow; no proposal created; runtime_anomaly emitted.
- Multi-vulnerability per upcoming PM: AVA can propose convergence for MULTIPLE vulnerabilities into the same PM (e.g., asset has 3 open patches scheduled separately, AVA proposes one PM to address all 3); single signature_chains row references all N vulnerabilities + the PM.

**Fixtures:** `apps/api/test/fixtures/workflows/wf-ot4-convergence.json`.

---

**§15.4 summary:** 4 OT-security workflows specified. WF-OT1 is the standard vulnerability lifecycle with accepted_risk requiring dual signatures + 90d periodic re-evaluation. WF-OT2 codifies the §3.18 NAC dual-confirmation hard requirement for any quarantine action AND the explicit refusal to auto-quarantine clinical-critical or life-support assets. WF-OT3 handles cross-source advisory dedup via §3.14 vector similarity ≥ 0.95 and cross-pack interaction with clinical's WF-OC3 for medical-device advisories. WF-OT4 is the marquee #26 differentiator: a single cross-pack write that creates ONE signature_chains row referencing BOTH the ot_asset_vulnerability AND the maintenance_work_order, making convergence an auditable architectural decision rather than a paired hack. This cross-pack atomicity is structurally possible only because ot-security is an OVERLAY on maintenance-core, not a separate platform.

**Workflow deep-dive section complete: all 30 workflows specified across §15.1-§15.4.** Total Phase 4 scope at this point: 18 substrate (§13) + 4 packs (§14) + 30 workflows (§15) = the architectural skeleton. Remaining: 35 marquee end-to-end specs.

---

## 16. Marquee End-to-End Specifications

§5.1 enumerated 35 marquees as one-paragraph value statements. §16 expands each into implementation-ready form: substrate dependencies (§3.X + §14.X + §15.X cross-refs), setup fixtures, golden-path E2E with numbered assertions, negative tests, metric assertions (latency budget + audit row counts + signature_chains extension), provenance walk, fixture path. Each marquee pins a user-perceivable latency budget and an audit-trail commitment.

Categories follow §5.1's natural grouping: AI (#1-5), technician superpowers (#6-9), connected-network (#10-13), systemic differentiators (#14-17), WO-processing views (#18-22), category resets (#23-26), back-office reinventions (#27-30), edge reinventions (#31-35).

### 16.1 AI marquees (#1-5)

#### 16.1.1 Marquee #1 — Voice WO capture + AVA structuring

**Value:** Tap-mic-speak-submit beats Nuvolo's 7-form-field WO intake; AVA structures with full provenance.

**Substrate deps:** §3.8 Suggest-mode; §3.14 asset+location resolution; §3.7 mobile + `<RecordVoiceButton>` + `<WoConfirmationCard>`; §14.1.1 `maintenance_work_order`; §15.1.1 WF-1 target `submitted`.

**Setup fixtures:** technician with `wo:create`; 5 assets (incl. pump 4521 UDI match); 3 locations (incl. Room 312); AVA tool `transcribeAndStructureWoVoiceCapture` `trust_state='suggest'`; §3.12 audio retention 90d.

**Golden path:** (1) Tech taps `<RecordVoiceButton>` 4s → voice memo to §3.12. (2) AVA transcribes `"Infusion pump 4521 in room 312 is alarming..."`. (3) Structured: `asset_id=<pump_4521.id>` (UDI 0.97), `location_id=<room_312.id>`, `category='display_alarm'`, `priority='high'`. (4) `<WoConfirmationCard>` shows draft + per-field confidence. (5) Submit → WF-1 `submitted`.

**Assertions:** voice → confirmation card p95 ≤ 4s; idempotent on `client_idempotency_uuid`; 1 `ava_proposals` (`synthesis_kind='wo_voice_structure'`); 1 `evidence_artifacts`.

**Negative tests:** no recognizable asset → manual selection; silence < 1s → no row; network drop → §3.7 queue; AVA timeout > 10s → manual fallback.

**Provenance walk:** voice → `attachment_uploads`+`evidence_artifacts`; transcription → `ava_proposals`; submit → `maintenance_work_orders` + `task_projection` refresh + `audit_logs.event_kind='wo.submitted'` linking `ava_proposals.id`.

**Fixture path:** `apps/api/test/fixtures/marquees/mq-01-voice-wo-capture.json`

---

#### 16.1.2 Marquee #2 — "Invisible Manual" (AVA-native troubleshooting)

**Value:** AVA dynamically synthesizes inline troubleshooting checklist from ingested service manual — not text. ServiceNow/Nuvolo AI cannot orchestrate UI components.

**Substrate deps:** §3.8 transient `FormDefinition`; canon §11 document AI; §3.14 manual-passage retrieval; §3.7 mobile + `<ChecklistRunner>`; §3.6 per-step signatures when verification required; WF-1 `in_progress`.

**Setup fixtures:** WO `in_progress` on Baxter Sigma Spectrum pump; pump's 200-page service PDF ingested + chunked into pgvector; AVA tool `synthesizeTroubleshootingChecklist` `trust_state='execute'`; §3.14 `vector_index_entry` per chunk.

**Golden path:** (1) Tech opens WO mobile, taps mic, `"AVA, what does Error Code E-42 mean on a Baxter Sigma Spectrum?"`. (2) §3.14 vector returns top-3 chunks. (3) AVA invokes synthesis tool; emits 6-item `FormDefinition`. (4) Validator synthesis-mode passes (≤20 fields, ≤depth 3, vocabulary check). (5) `<ChecklistRunner>` renders inline. (6) Outcomes stamped into `ava_proposals.synthesized_form_def`.

**Assertions:** voice → first item p95 ≤ 3s; validator no errors; 1 `ava_proposals` (`validator_passed=true`); checklist NOT persisted to `metadata.form_definitions`; manual-passage citations per step.

**Negative tests:** no ingested manual → "no manual available", suggest `<BarcodeScanner>`; non-primitive → `SYNTHESIS_INVALID_PRIMITIVE`; > 20 fields → `SYNTHESIS_FIELD_CAP_EXCEEDED`; mobile-ineligible on sync-eligible collection → refused.

**Provenance walk:** transcription → `ava_proposals` (kind='troubleshooting_checklist'); each step → `audit_logs` row with step_index + outcome + `vector_index_entry.id`; verification steps additionally write `electronic_signatures`.

**Fixture path:** `apps/api/test/fixtures/marquees/mq-02-invisible-manual.json`

#### 16.1.3 Marquee #3 — "Walk-by" frictionless nurse intake

**Value:** Nurse scans QR + voice memo + walks away. No login, no portal. AVA triages + routes to biomed. Nuvolo/ServiceNow licensing makes this expensive.

**Substrate deps:** §3.9 public intake (signed-token, canon §29.2 kid); §3.12 attachment; §3.8 AVA structured extraction; §3.14 vector; §15.X public_intake processor; §14.1.1 `maintenance_work_order`.

**Setup fixtures:** active `public_intake_tokens` scoped to `asset=infusion_pump_4521`, `purpose='walkby_nurse_intake'`; pack `public_intake.schemas[]`; AVA voice-triage tool; §3.12 voice retention 30d.

**Golden path:** (1) Nurse scans QR → `/p/<tokenCode>`. (2) Page: "Hold to record" + asset photo. (3) Holds, says `"Screen is frozen and it keeps beeping"`, releases. (4) `POST /attachment-url` → presigned S3 URL. (5) Browser uploads audio direct to S3. (6) `POST /submit` with `{clientIdempotencyUuid, payload, attachments}`. (7) Response: `{submissionCode}` ONLY. (8) `PublicIntakeProcessor` awaits scan-clean; AVA voice-triage. (9) Returns `category='display_alarm'`, `priority='medium'` (life_support designation tunes), `suggested_assignee_group='biomed'`. (10) Worker dispatches under system principal `intake:dispatch:walkby_nurse_intake`; creates WO. (11) Maria sees WO within projection lag (< 2s).

**Assertions:** QR scan → response p95 ≤ 1.5s (audio upload async); response ONLY `submissionCode` (zero operational data leak asserted); WO appears p95 ≤ 8s of scan-clean; `use_count` incremented atomically.

**Negative tests:** expired/revoked → 410 generic; rate-limit 101/min/IP_hash → 429 + `RuntimeAnomaly`; AV scan dirty → `outcome='refused_scan_failed'`; `use_count > max_uses` → 410.

**Provenance walk:** issuance → `public_intake_tokens`; submission → `public_intake_submissions` (ip_hash + ua_hash); voice → `evidence_artifacts`; AVA triage → `ava_proposals`; WO → `audit_logs.event_kind='wo.submitted'` with `triggered_by_intake_submission_id`.

**Fixture path:** `apps/api/test/fixtures/marquees/mq-03-walkby-nurse-intake.json`

#### 16.1.4 Marquee #4 — Deterministic parts staging

**Value:** Tech sees "Part reserved in Bin B4" BEFORE leaving desk. Explainable rules (frequency × recency × keyword match) — NOT trained ML. Post-G6 ML refines on SAME explainable substrate.

**Substrate deps:** §3.14 vector (asset model + symptom keywords → parts); §14.1.1 `parts_consumption` history; §14.1.1 `parts_requisition` taskable; AVA deterministic rules engine.

**Setup fixtures:** 5 `parts_catalog` rows (incl. controller_board_bxsigma_v3, on_hand=8); 50 historical `parts_consumption` rows on Sigma Spectrum pumps over 18mo; 1 incoming WO with asset_id + symptom keywords.

**Golden path:** (1) Worker pipeline post-submission receives `(wo_id, asset_id, symptom_keywords)`. (2) Engine queries: `parts_consumption` for asset_class last 365d ranked by frequency; symptom cross-ref via §3.14 vector; recency weight. (3) Score = `frequency × recency × keyword_match`; > 0.85 AND `on_hand ≥ 1` qualifies. (4) Engine writes `parts_requisition` (`source='ava_deterministic_staging'`); atomic decrement `inventory_lot.quantity_on_hand`. (5) Mobile renders "Part reserved in Bin B4". (6) Click → `<ProvenanceSheet>` shows ranking factors + 3 historical WOs.

**Assertions:** staging p95 ≤ 600ms; quantity=1 atomically reserved; provenance accessible; `engine_rule_set_version` on proposal.

**Negative tests:** score < 0.85 → no reservation; on_hand = 0 → offer `<PartFinder>` MQ-#10; ambiguous (3+ tied) → top-3 for tech choice; no history → no reservation.

**Provenance walk:** invocation → `audit_logs.event_kind='parts_staging.invoked'`; results → `ava_proposals` (`synthesis_kind='deterministic_parts_recommendation'`, `engine_rule_set_version`); reservation → `parts_requisitions` + `audit_logs.event_kind='req.created'`.

#### 16.1.5 Marquee #5 — "Break-Glass" PHI access

**Value:** 10-min unmask with reason code + fresh WebAuthn; auto-revoke; HIPAA-auditable. ServiceNow/Nuvolo ACLs static.

**Substrate deps:** §3.10 break-glass; §3.6 e-signature; §3.7.5.1 re-auth 'responsibility' (WebAuthn); §14.2.1 `ehr_context_link` hard-deny class; `BreakGlassRevokerService`; maintenance-core `maintenance_work_order.patient_context`.

**Setup fixtures:** WO #1042 with `patient_context` (`break_glass_eligible=true`, `confidentiality_class='sensitive'`); value `"Airborne Isolation — N95 Required, Room 312 — VRE precautions"` (masked); tech with `compliance:break_glass:request`; WebAuthn enrolled; reason code `clinical_maintenance__break_glass_emergency_repair`.

**Golden path:** (1) Tech opens WO; `patient_context` masked. (2) Tech taps `<BreakGlassButton>`; sheet for reason_code + WebAuthn. (3) Selects "Emergency Repair"; TouchID. (4) POST `/api/compliance/break-glass/grants`. (5) Three-stage check: hard-deny ✓ eligibility ✓ row visibility ✓. (6) Fresh WebAuthn < 60s ✓; reason_code 'break_glass' meaning ✓. (7) Inside `withAudit`: `electronic_signatures` + `signature_chains` + `field_unmask_grants` (granted_until = now() + 600s); cache-bust. (8) Response `{grantId, grantedUntil}`. Re-fetch; evaluator stage-2 ALLOW; unmasked. (9) After 600s: revoker stamps OR evaluator fail-safe.

**Assertions:** tap → unmasked p95 ≤ 2s (WebAuthn dominates); exactly 1 `field_unmask_grants` + 1 `electronic_signatures` + 1 `signature_chains` row per grant; after 600s: masked again; HIPAA query via `ix_fug_active`.

**Negative tests:** `unrelated_patient_context` hard-deny → `BREAK_GLASS_PROPERTY_INELIGIBLE` (admin cannot override); stale WebAuthn → `WEBAUTHN_STALE`; no row visibility → §28 403; reason code wrong meanings → refused; duration > 3600s → clamped.

**Provenance walk:** tap → `audit_logs.event_kind='break_glass.requested'`; WebAuthn → `audit_logs.event_kind='webauthn.verify_ok'`; grant → `field_unmask_grants` + `electronic_signatures` + `signature_chains`; each read → `audit_logs.event_kind='field_access.unmasked'` with `grant_id`; auto-revoke → `audit_logs.event_kind='grant.auto_revoked'`.

### 16.2 Technician superpowers (#6-9)

#### 16.2.1 Marquee #6 — Glove-Mode swipe UX

**Value:** `<SwipeProgressCard>` / `<ThumbToggle>` / `<LargeActionButton>` (64dp min tap target). Built for nitrile-glove, one-handed, ladder use. ServiceNow's mobile is a miniaturized desktop.

**Substrate deps:** §3.7 mobile parity + field-tool primitives; canon §27 UI Builder; WF-1 state transitions (right=start, left=block, long-right=complete).

**Setup fixtures:** WO in `assigned`; mobile fixture with `@hubblewave/ui-primitives-mobile` adapter; gesture-simulator harness for E2E.

**Golden path:** (1) Tech opens WO list; sees stack of `<SwipeProgressCard>` items. (2) Swipes right on top card → WF-1 `assigned → in_progress`; haptic feedback < 16ms after gesture-end. (3) Inside detail, opens checklist; taps `<ThumbToggle>` on full-row zone for each item (no precision tapping). (4) Long-swipe-right on detail → `in_progress → completed`; closure signature sheet pops up. (5) Web equivalent: same `<SwipeProgressCard>` renders with drag (mouse-down + drag-right + mouse-up) producing identical state transition.

**Assertions:** gesture-end → UI feedback p95 ≤ 16ms (60fps frame budget); §3.7 primitive parity scanner asserts both `-web` and `-mobile` export every primitive used; tap targets ≥ 64dp on iOS + Android (Reanimated layout measure).

**Negative tests:** accidental short-swipe → no state change (must clear 75% of card width); web drag without releasing → no transition until release event; primitive missing from one adapter → CI fails on §3.7 parity scanner.

**Provenance walk:** swipe → `audit_logs.event_kind='wo.started'` (or block/complete) with `triggered_via='swipe_gesture'` annotation in payload (lets QA replay gesture telemetry).

**Fixture path:** `apps/api/test/fixtures/marquees/mq-06-glove-mode-swipe.json`

---

#### 16.2.2 Marquee #7 — Generative close-out

**Value:** Tech speaks resolution → AVA renders compliance-grade close-out narrative + reason codes + parts log + closure signature. 3-minute typing chore becomes 5-second voice memo with HIGHER audit quality.

**Substrate deps:** §3.8 AVA UI synthesis; canon §11 voice; §3.6 regulated-action; §3.7.5.1 closure signature meaning='closure' (WebAuthn); §3.6 Merkle batch for end-of-shift bulk close.

**Setup fixtures:** WO in `in_progress` with checklist 100%; AVA tool `synthesizeWoCloseout` `trust_state='preview'` (per canon §12 — high-stakes Preview before persist); reason-code seeds for `corrective_action_taken`, `calibration_verified`, `parts_consumed`.

**Golden path:** (1) Tech taps mic at WO end: `"Swapped the intake O-ring, recalibrated pressure to 50 PSI, ran a test cycle, all good."`. (2) AVA transcribes + synthesizes: resolution_narrative (FDA-grade prose), reason_codes (`corrective_action_taken` + `calibration_verified`), parts_consumption auto-populated (matches §16.1.4 reservation), pre-filled resolution fields. (3) `<SwipeProgressCard>` shows draft for review. (4) Tech swipes right to approve. (5) Single-action: closure signature via §3.6 chain (Plan Fix 41 linearization). End-of-shift batch: §3.6 Merkle batch root over N closures with one WebAuthn assertion.

**Assertions:** voice → draft render p95 ≤ 5s; reason codes auto-selected from regulated-action vocabulary (no free-text); 1 `electronic_signatures` + 1 `signature_chains` row per WO; Merkle batch root cardinality assertion when bulk-closing.

**Negative tests:** voice contains regulated keyword (`patient_identifier`) → AVA refuses to include; redacted with `[redacted-pii]`; safety officer notified. Calibration value out of tolerance → close-out blocked with "value exceeds asset tolerance; manual review required".

**Provenance walk:** voice → `evidence_artifacts` (audio); AVA synthesis → `ava_proposals` (`synthesis_kind='wo_closeout'`); approval → `electronic_signatures` + `signature_chains` + `audit_logs.event_kind='wo.completed'`. Audit asks "show me every close-out signed under reason `calibration_verified` in this quarter" → indexed via `signature_chains.payload->>signature_meaning`.

**Fixture path:** `apps/api/test/fixtures/marquees/mq-07-generative-closeout.json`

#### 16.2.3 Marquee #8 — Dirty Nameplate Vision Extraction

**Value:** AVA OCR + fuzzy-match resolves scratched/dusty/dim asset nameplates to asset registry with confidence score. Barcode-missing kills Nuvolo customers in the field; this is the answer.

**Substrate deps:** §3.7 mobile + `<NameplateCamera>` primitive; canon §11 AVA Vision; §3.14 vector match for fuzzy asset registry resolution; §3.12 photo evidence; fallback to `<BarcodeScanner>` if confidence < 70%.

**Setup fixtures:** 200 assets in registry incl. one with intentional nameplate variations: serial `BX-2026-4521` indexed; `<NameplateCamera>` primitive registered; AVA Vision tool `extractAssetNameplate(imageBlob)` `trust_state='execute'`.

**Golden path:** (1) Tech opens `<NameplateCamera>` on mobile; snaps photo of scratched, dusty pump nameplate. (2) AVA Vision OCRs + fuzzy-matches: returns top-3 candidates with confidence scores: `{asset_4521: 0.94, asset_4527: 0.71, asset_4513: 0.62}`. (3) Confidence > 90% → auto-opens asset_4521 detail; nameplate photo attached as `asset_pin`. (4) Mobile shows confidence + provenance: which OCR'd characters matched which registry fields.

**Assertions:** photo capture → confidence display p95 ≤ 2.5s; OCR + fuzzy match deterministic given same input + registry state; `<NameplateCamera>` primitive parity confirmed by §3.7 scanner.

**Negative tests:** confidence 70-90% → surfaces top-3 candidates for tap-confirm (not auto-open); confidence < 70% → falls back to `<BarcodeScanner>` with "AVA couldn't recognize this nameplate" + photo still attached as `asset_pin`; no asset_registry rows at all → manual asset selection.

**Provenance walk:** photo → `attachment_uploads`+`evidence_artifacts`; AVA call → `ava_proposals` (`synthesis_kind='nameplate_ocr'`, factors_jsonb={ocr_text, fuzzy_match_scores}); asset open → `audit_logs.event_kind='asset.opened_via_nameplate'`.

**Fixture path:** `apps/api/test/fixtures/marquees/mq-08-dirty-nameplate.json`

#### 16.2.4 Marquee #9 — Elevator Mode (offline as identity)

**Value:** Every action locally optimistic with <16ms UI response. Full shift in airplane mode. Inline "Offline" badge, never a spinner. Speed is the #1 complaint against Nuvolo; this is the answer.

**Substrate deps:** §3.7 Elevator Mode acceptance contract; WatermelonDB local store; §3.7 sync conflict resolution (header server_wins / completion last_write_wins); §3.6 offline signature queue + post-reconnect WebAuthn confirm.

**Setup fixtures:** mobile fixture with WatermelonDB pre-seeded with 50 records (assigned WOs + assets + parts); network controller for E2E (block/unblock outbound HTTP); §3.6 `offline_signature_queue` cleanup hook.

**Golden path (FULL E2E):** (1) Tech opens mobile online; pulls 5 WOs (full sync). (2) Network blocked. (3) Tech opens WO #1: instant render (local DB). (4) Swipes through 3 state transitions: each <16ms UI feedback; queued for sync. (5) Captures photo: stored locally with `attachment_uploads.status='presigned_offline'`. (6) Voice close-out: AVA-mock returns canned synthesis (or offline AVA stub depending on capability); rendered locally. (7) Signs close-out: §3.6 offline_signature_queue row inserted (pending_reauth). (8) Repeats for WO #2-5. (9) Network restored. (10) Sync queue flushes: each WO write resolves per server_wins/LWW policy; attachments upload; signature queue confirmed via single WebAuthn assertion + Merkle batch root binding all 5 signatures.

**Assertions:** UI feedback per gesture p95 ≤ 16ms (60fps frame budget); ZERO blocking spinners in entire flow (asserted via UI fixture); after reconnect, all 5 WOs reach `completed` state in server DB within 8s of sync flush; one merkle_root signature_chains row binds all 5 closure signatures; offline_signature_queue rows deleted on successful confirm.

**Negative tests:** signature conflict (server modified during offline window) → operator review queue; sync conflict on header field → server_wins, conflict row in `mobile_sync_conflicts`; sync conflict on completion field → last_write_wins, audit captures both versions; AV scan dirty on offline-attached photo → quarantine, WO close requires retake.

**Provenance walk:** each offline action → WatermelonDB row with `local_id`; sync push → server-side row insert + `audit_logs.event_kind='wo.<state>.synced'` with `offline_originated_at`; signature confirm → `electronic_signatures` rows from `offline_signature_queue` rolled into one merkle_root `signature_chains` row.

**Fixture path:** `apps/api/test/fixtures/marquees/mq-09-elevator-mode.json`

### 16.3 Connected-network superpowers (#10-13)

#### 16.3.1 Marquee #10 — Peer-to-peer parts locator

**Value:** Tech asks "Find Part" → AVA queries stockrooms + every clocked-in tech's cart stock; replies "John on Floor 2 has 3 of these — ping him?". Inventory becomes a dynamic mobile network. Privacy: presence opt-in.

**Substrate deps:** §14.1.1 `inventory_location` + `mobile_inventory_holding` + `technician_presence`; §3.15 graph (proximity); §3.14 vector (cross-ref part keywords); MQ-#4 deterministic engine reused.

**Setup fixtures:** 5 stockroom rows; 8 active techs with `mobile_inventory_holding` rows; `technician_presence` opt-in for 6 of 8; 1 in-progress WO needing controller_board_bxsigma_v3; tech privacy policy: `technician_presence.visibility='maintenance_team_peers'`.

**Golden path:** (1) Tech taps "Find Part" on WO. (2) Engine queries: (a) `inventory_location` rooms with on_hand ≥ 1; (b) `mobile_inventory_holding` of clocked-in techs whose presence is opted-in AND visible to peers; (c) intersect with `technician_presence` proximity (≤ same floor, optional). (3) Returns ranked: `"John Smith (Floor 2): 3 controller boards | Stockroom B4: 8 boards (Floor 1)"`. (4) Tech taps "Ask John". (5) `parts_requisition` created with `status='pending_peer_consent'`, `source='peer_transfer'`, `holder_user_id=john`. (6) John gets push notification: "Maria needs 1 controller board for WO-1042 — accept?". (7) John taps Accept → status flips to `confirmed_peer_transfer`; `parts_consumption` row updated when Maria physically receives.

**Assertions:** "Find Part" → ranked list p95 ≤ 800ms; opted-OUT presence rows ABSENT from results (privacy invariant asserted); peer-transfer requisition has `holder_user_id` set; consent flow audited.

**Negative tests:** zero opted-in peers with the part → only stockroom suggestions; john declines → requisition canceled; john ignores > 5min → auto-cancel + try next candidate; presence privacy revoked mid-flow → AVA suggestion list refreshes without that tech.

**Provenance walk:** AVA query → `ava_proposals` (`synthesis_kind='p2p_parts_locator'`, factors_jsonb={stockroom_results, peer_results, ranking_basis}); requisition → `parts_requisitions` row with `source='peer_transfer'`; peer consent → `audit_logs.event_kind='peer_transfer.confirmed'`; transfer execution → `parts_consumption` with `transfer_origin_user_id`.

**Fixture path:** `apps/api/test/fixtures/marquees/mq-10-p2p-parts.json`

#### 16.3.2 Marquee #11 — "Tribal Knowledge" Asset Pins

**Value:** Veteran tech says "the manual says X, but just jiggle the bypass valve first" → AVA transcribes + stores in `asset_pin`. Junior tech later scans asset → AVA surfaces: "3 technicians have noted a quirk with this valve". Solves "veteran retires, knowledge lost".

**Substrate deps:** §14.1.1 `asset_pin` collection (vector_indexed on voice_note_transcript); §3.14 vector match (semantic surfacing); §3.7 mobile voice capture; canon §11 transcription + summarization.

**Setup fixtures:** 1 pump asset (asset_4521); 3 existing `asset_pin` rows (voice + photo); §3.14 vector index entries for transcripts; veteran tech with `wo:create` + `asset_pin:create` permissions.

**Golden path:** (1) Veteran taps mic on asset_4521 record: `"Hey guys, the manual says X, but just jiggle the bypass valve first before resetting."`. (2) AVA transcribes; classifies severity (`tip` vs `warning` vs `safety_critical`); summarizes 1-line headline. (3) `asset_pin` row written (`pin_kind='voice_note'`, body=transcript, severity classification). (4) §3.14 vector index updated. (5) Later: junior tech scans asset_4521 (MQ-#8 nameplate or QR). (6) AVA proactively surfaces: "3 technicians have noted a quirk with this valve — tap to hear."; renders top-3 pins ranked by severity + recency. (7) Junior taps → veteran's voice plays at 1× with AVA-summarized transcript.

**Assertions:** voice → pin saved p95 ≤ 4s; asset open with pins → surface render p95 ≤ 1s (vector index hit); severity classification deterministic for fixture inputs; pin retrieval respects §28 (junior can only see pins on assets they can read).

**Negative tests:** voice silent < 1s → no pin; transcription confidence < 0.5 → flagged for review (not surfaced); pin marked `safety_critical` AND not signed-off by safety officer → blocked from surfacing until reviewed.

**Provenance walk:** voice → `evidence_artifacts` (audio); transcription → `ava_proposals` (`synthesis_kind='asset_pin_transcribe'`); `asset_pin` row with `source_ava_proposal_id`; surface event → `audit_logs.event_kind='asset_pin.surfaced'`.

**Fixture path:** `apps/api/test/fixtures/marquees/mq-11-tribal-knowledge.json`

#### 16.3.3 Marquee #12 — Contextual Floor-Plan Routing ("Blue Dot")

**Value:** WO says "West Wing Floor 3 Utility Closet 3B". Tech taps "Take me to Asset" → Google-Maps-style indoor navigation with highlighted path. Nuvolo's space module is heavy + desktop-leaning; this is fluid + mobile-first + offline-cached.

**Substrate deps:** §3.15 graph (spatial + relationship); §14.3.1 `space` + `location_relationship`; §14.3.7 `<FloorPlanRouter>` plugin; §14.3.X `cad_drawing_link` / `ifc_space_link` (facilities overlay); §3.15 `routeSolve` (Dijkstra/A*).

**Setup fixtures:** facilities overlay installed; floor-plan graph for "West Wing Floor 3" loaded (rooms, corridors, doors); CAD drawing linked; tech `technician_presence` location = "West Wing Floor 1 Lobby".

**Golden path:** (1) WO open; tech taps "Take me to Asset". (2) `<FloorPlanRouter>` plugin invokes `routeSolve(graph_id='west_wing', from=lobby, to=closet_3b, weighting='walking_time')`. (3) Returns ordered path: `lobby → stairwell_A → floor_3_corridor → utility_closet_3b` with estimated 3 minutes. (4) Mobile renders floor plan with highlighted path + blue dot at tech's current location (technician_presence updates). (5) As tech moves, blue dot updates in near-real-time (WebSocket from technician_presence stream).

**Assertions:** route compute p95 ≤ 300ms (Dijkstra over ≤500 nodes typical floor); floor plan render p95 ≤ 1s; offline cached if pre-fetched during pull-sync; door-locked metadata filter (after-hours edges excluded if applicable).

**Negative tests:** target room not in graph → "Location not mapped" + photo guidance fallback; tech's current location not known → start from a configurable default (e.g., shift-start anchor); door-locked after-hours route → alternate or "no accessible path" with notify-security option.

**Provenance walk:** route compute → `audit_logs.event_kind='routing.computed'` with from/to/weighting payload; presence updates → `technician_presence` row updates with `last_seen_at`; if door access fails → `audit_logs.event_kind='door.access_denied'` linked to badge-reader telemetry.

**Fixture path:** `apps/api/test/fixtures/marquees/mq-12-floor-plan-routing.json`

#### 16.3.4 Marquee #13 — Smart LOTO with AVA Vision

**Value:** OSHA 1910.147 lockout/tagout enforced step-by-step via AVA Vision lock-confirmation. Each verified step writes `loto_step_check` chained into `signature_chains`. Procedure becomes mathematically auditable evidence.

**Substrate deps:** §14.1.1 `permit_to_work` (regulated taskable) + `loto_step_check` (regulated); §3.6 signatures + Merkle batch; §3.12 photo evidence; canon §11 AVA Vision; §15.1.8 WF-8 permit-to-work workflow.

**Setup fixtures:** permit_to_work in `authorized` state; pack-declared LOTO procedure (5 steps: electrical_disconnect, lockout_pad_install, voltage_zero_verify, tag_attach, secondary_lock_install); AVA Vision tool `verifyLockPlacement(imageBlob, expected_lock_type)` `trust_state='execute'`.

**Golden path:** (1) Tech opens `<LotoStepRunner>` for permit. (2) Step 1 prompts "Disconnect electrical service". Tech actions; taps "Mark Complete". (3) Step 2: "Install lockout pad on disconnect". Tech installs lock, snaps photo. (4) AVA Vision invoked with image + expected lock_type='red_clamshell_padlock'. (5) Confidence > 70% AND lock matches expected type → step verified; `loto_step_check` row written with §3.6 signature. (6) Tech can swipe to step 3. (7) Steps 3-5 follow same pattern. (8) On completion: all 5 `loto_step_check` rows linked to one Merkle batch root in `signature_chains`. (9) WF-8 transitions `authorized → loto_in_progress → work_in_progress`.

**Assertions:** photo capture + AVA verify p95 ≤ 3s; step BLOCKED if confidence < 70% with "AVA cannot confirm lock placement; retake or escalate"; all 5 `loto_step_check` rows present and linked to permit; Merkle batch root binds them.

**Negative tests:** wrong lock type in photo (e.g., installed yellow but expected red) → step blocked with structured error; vision fails service-side → fallback to manual safety officer confirmation; tech tries to skip step → workflow refuses (steps enforced in sequence per WF-8); permit expires mid-LOTO → hard-stop work + escalate per WF-8 emergency_stop edge case.

**Provenance walk:** each step photo → `evidence_artifacts`; AVA verification → `ava_proposals` (`synthesis_kind='loto_lock_verify'`, factors_jsonb={lock_type, confidence, ocr_extracted_text}); `loto_step_check` row + linked `electronic_signatures` chained via `signature_chains`; on permit close, Merkle batch root encodes all 5 step signatures.

**Fixture path:** `apps/api/test/fixtures/marquees/mq-13-smart-loto.json`

### 16.4 Systemic differentiators (#14-17)

#### 16.4.1 Marquee #14 — Auditor Kiosk (Joint Commission, FDA)

**Value:** Compliance Officer issues §3.11 kiosk session bound to auditor's iPad. Auditor sees PM compliance + signature_chains ledger + CSV/PDF export. No edit affordance anywhere. Hands auditor mathematically verifiable evidence. ServiceNow/Nuvolo need manual prep + custom dashboards.

**Substrate deps:** §3.11 kiosk session tokens (canon §29.7 audience='kiosk'); §3.6 signature_chains ledger; §14.1.5 `ws_auditor_kiosk` workspace; §14.1.6 `<AuditorKioskShell>` plugin; §28 evaluator hard-rejects writes from kiosk audience.

**Setup fixtures:** Compliance Officer with `identity:kiosk:issue`; iPad device fingerprint pre-registered; kiosk_sessions purpose `joint_commission_audit`; 200 signed `electronic_signatures` rows + their `signature_chains` rows across last 12mo.

**Golden path:** (1) Compliance Officer issues kiosk session via `POST /api/identity/kiosk-sessions`; receives code. (2) Hands auditor iPad with QR code; auditor scans → `/api/public/kiosk/<code>/bind`. (3) iPad's user_agent + screen_dims + tz_offset → device fingerprint computed; kiosk JWT minted with `aud='kiosk'`, `permitted_actions=['read']`, `workspace_id=ws_auditor_kiosk`. (4) iPad navigates to `ws_auditor_kiosk` (read-only shell). (5) Auditor browses: PM compliance dashboard, drill-down on critical life-safety assets, signature_chains ledger with date filters. (6) Auditor taps "Export" → CSV/PDF generated server-side, no edit affordances anywhere. (7) End of audit: Compliance Officer revokes session in one tap; subsequent iPad API calls → 401.

**Assertions:** issue → bind round-trip p95 ≤ 2s; kiosk JWT carries device_fp_hash; ANY write attempt by kiosk audience → §28 minimal 403 + AccessAuditPort.logAccessDenied row; revoke → 401 within next token check; CSV/PDF exports complete + downloadable within 5s for 12mo data window.

**Negative tests:** mismatched device fingerprint (different iPad presents same JWT) → 401; expired session bind → 410; non-`workspace_id` route attempt → 404; replay of kiosk JWT after revoke → 401; CSV export of records auditor's workspace doesn't reach → empty (no leak).

**Provenance walk:** issue → `kiosk_sessions` row + `audit_logs.event_kind='kiosk.issued'`; bind → `audit_logs.event_kind='kiosk.bound'` with device_fp_hash; each read → `audit_logs.event_kind='kiosk.api_call'` with workspace_id + endpoint; revoke → `audit_logs.event_kind='kiosk.revoked'`. The whole audit window's activity is traceable to the kiosk_session row.

**Fixture path:** `apps/api/test/fixtures/marquees/mq-14-auditor-kiosk.json`

#### 16.4.2 Marquee #15 — Zero-Login Contractor Flow

**Value:** External vendor receives §3.11 magic-link via SMS/email; mobile web view (`<ContractorPortal>`); attach photo + voice close-out + e-sign. No app/password/training/per-seat license. ServiceNow/Nuvolo charge per-seat → most hospitals manage contractors by email + lose audit trail.

**Substrate deps:** §3.11 collaborator_invitations (canon §29.7 audience='collaborator'); §3.12 attachments; §3.6 e-signature; §14.1.6 `<ContractorPortal>` plugin; §14.1.5 `ws_auditor_kiosk` is NOT this — collaborator audience differs from kiosk audience.

**Setup fixtures:** WO routed to vendor "Acme Elevator Co"; coordinator with `identity:collaborator:issue`; vendor contact email + phone in `vendor_contact`; pack-declared `permitted_actions=['view', 'attach_photo', 'add_note', 'sign_closeout']`.

**Golden path:** (1) Coordinator routes WO to vendor; clicks "Invite Vendor". (2) `POST /api/identity/collaborator-invitations` with `scope_collection_id=maintenance_work_order`, `scope_record_id=<WO.id>`, `permitted_actions=[...]`, `delivery_method='email+sms'`. (3) System sends magic-link via email + SMS. (4) Vendor taps link on mobile browser → `<ContractorPortal>` loads. (5) Vendor sees: WO, asset, location, attach photo button, voice memo button, e-sign panel. (6) Vendor attaches 3 photos + voice memo close-out. (7) Vendor e-signs (single signature; collaborator session limits to ≤ 4h post-redeem). (8) System generates `electronic_signatures` row with `signer_user_id=<collaborator_principal>` (system-mapped user for vendor); signature_chains extended. (9) Coordinator gets notified; WF-2 entitlement_intercept transitions to `vendor_completed`. (10) Per-asset `vendor_scorecard` recomputed.

**Assertions:** invite → SMS+email delivery p95 ≤ 30s (operational measure of NotificationService); magic-link redeem → portal load p95 ≤ 3s; single-use redemption (replay → 410); attach photos + sign → all in `signature_chains` with `signer_user_id` resolved to system collaborator principal; vendor cannot access ANY other WO (scope_record_id strictly enforced by §28 evaluator + audience guard).

**Negative tests:** vendor tries to navigate to `/wo/<other_id>` → 403 minimal shape; magic-link redemption attempt 2 → 410; collaborator JWT used after 4h working session expiry → 401; vendor uploads malicious file → §3.12 scan-pipeline quarantines, vendor sees "file rejected"; vendor signature_meaning='closure' but reason_code not seeded → publish refused.

**Provenance walk:** invitation → `collaborator_invitations` row + `audit_logs.event_kind='collaborator.invited'`; redeem → `consumed_at` stamped + JWT issued + `audit_logs.event_kind='collaborator.redeemed'`; each attachment → `attachment_uploads` chain with `collaborator_invitation_id` annotation; close-out signature → `electronic_signatures` + `signature_chains` linking to invitation. Compliance officer can query "every external collaborator action on this asset in the last 12mo" in one click.

**Fixture path:** `apps/api/test/fixtures/marquees/mq-15-zero-login-contractor.json`

#### 16.4.3 Marquee #16 — Smart Sprint Batching

**Value:** AVA-proposed Sprints via deterministic clustering (locality × PM proximity × skills × scoring). Each Sprint shows clustering criteria + scoring weights. Auditable. Dispatcher one-tap approves. Post-G6 trained ML refines weights without changing structure.

**Substrate deps:** §3.2 task_projection; §14.1.1 `pm_schedule` + `technician_presence`; §3.15 floor-plan adjacency; AVA deterministic clustering engine; §14.1.6 `<SprintBoard>` plugin.

**Setup fixtures:** 50 open WOs across 4 floors; 8 active techs with `technician_presence` + skill matrix; 12 `pm_schedule` rows due in next 14 days; AVA clustering tool `proposeSprints(scope, technician_id, horizon_minutes)` `trust_state='preview'`.

**Golden path:** (1) Dispatcher opens `<SprintBoard>`. (2) Selects tech "Sarah" + 240-minute window. (3) AVA invokes clustering: (a) cluster 50 open WOs by locality (floor + wing); (b) overlay PMs due in next 14d sharing locality + Sarah's skills; (c) intersect with Sarah's current presence (Floor 4); (d) score by `total_estimated_time × locality_proximity ÷ trips_saved`. (4) Returns proposal: `"Sarah, 4 WOs morning: 3 reactive Floor 4 + 1 HVAC PM Tuesday Floor 4. 95 min, 2 trips saved."`. (5) Dispatcher reviews provenance sheet: clustering criteria + scoring weights + filtered candidates. (6) Dispatcher taps "Apply"; all 4 WOs reassigned to Sarah with linked `dispatch_assignment` rows.

**Assertions:** Sprint proposal compute p95 ≤ 1.2s; deterministic for same fixture inputs + presence state; Sprint card shows clustering criteria + scoring weights (explainability mandate); dispatcher MUST approve (not auto-applied per canon §12 Preview mode).

**Negative tests:** Sarah skill mismatch on candidate WOs → excluded from Sprint with reason; Sarah presence inactive → no Sprint proposed; locality data unavailable for an asset → falls back to wing-level grouping with reduced confidence score; multi-Sprint proposal rejected if any candidate WO already assigned to another tech.

**Provenance walk:** clustering invocation → `ava_proposals` (`synthesis_kind='sprint_proposal'`, factors_jsonb={candidate_wos, clustering_basis, scoring_weights}); approval → bulk `audit_logs.event_kind='wo.assigned'` rows + `dispatch_assignment` rows linking to Sprint proposal_id; dispatcher can query "show me every Sprint approved this week by clustering_basis" via materialized view.

#### 16.4.4 Marquee #17 — Repair-vs-Replace Score

**Value:** Every asset carries Replacement Urgency Score (deterministic rubric: quantitative factors + transparent sentiment from close-out narratives). Every score explainable end-to-end. Maintenance Manager sign-off before forward to Finance. ServiceNow/Nuvolo treat this as a separate "asset analytics" SKU.

**Substrate deps:** §14.1.1 `asset` (cumulative repair cost via `parts_consumption` aggregate) + `warranty` + `vendor_scorecard`; §14.1.1 `asset_pin` + close-out narratives; AVA deterministic sentiment lexicon (pack-shipped); §14.1.6 `<ReplacementUrgencyScore>` plugin; §3.16 `capital_replacement_request` cross-ref.

**Setup fixtures:** asset with 18mo of `parts_consumption` + WO history + 6 `asset_pin` voice notes + 3 close-out narratives with negative sentiment phrases; pack sentiment lexicon (positive/negative phrase library); rubric weights as published constants.

**Golden path:** (1) Maintenance Manager opens `<ReplacementUrgencyScore>` plugin for asset. (2) Engine computes:
  - Quantitative factors: `cumulative_repair_cost / replacement_cost` (0.42), `MTBF_trend` (declining 15% YoY), `warranty_remaining_days` (60), `downtime_hours_last_180d` (24).
  - Qualitative factors: lexicon scans close-out narratives + asset_pins for negative phrases; each match credited to a `qualitative_signal_match` row.
  - Final score: weighted sum, normalized 0-100 → 76.
(3) UI shows score 76 + provenance sheet: every factor + weight + contribution.
(4) Maintenance Manager reviews provenance (each lexicon match clickable to source); signs off via §3.6 `signature_meaning='approval'`.
(5) Score now forwarded to Finance dashboard (cross-pack reference for CFO).

**Assertions:** score compute p95 ≤ 800ms; deterministic for same inputs; every factor + weight shown in provenance; lexicon match attribution clickable to source WO/pin; sign-off creates `electronic_signatures` + `signature_chains` row.

**Negative tests:** asset with < 90d history → score returns "insufficient data" + factors visible (none); lexicon match in regulated/redacted field → ignored (audit notes redacted-skip); manager sign-off without provenance review → blocked (UX guardrail, not security); score above threshold AND no `capital_replacement_request` exists → AVA suggests creating one (per MQ-#27 Active Intercept).

**Provenance walk:** score compute → `ava_proposals` (`synthesis_kind='replacement_urgency_score'`, factors_jsonb=full breakdown + `engine_rule_set_version`); manager sign-off → `electronic_signatures` + `signature_chains`; forward to Finance → `audit_logs.event_kind='replacement_score.forwarded'` with `dest='cfo_dashboard'`.

### 16.5 WO-processing views (#18-22)

#### 16.5.1 Marquee #18 — Pivot-Kanban (contextual boards)

**Value:** Dispatcher's Kanban pivotable by state / floor / skill / category / priority. One-tap pivot. Drag-between-columns executes AVA macros (drag to "Electrical" → re-assigns + updates category + writes audit). ServiceNow's VTB groups only by state.

**Substrate deps:** §3.2 task_projection (the data source); §14.1.6 `<PivotKanban>` plugin; AVA macro tool registry (each pivot-column has a registered drag-action macro); §15.1.1 WF-1 transitions invoked by macros.

**Setup fixtures:** 100 WOs in `task_projection` with state/floor/skill/category/priority columns; AVA macros registered: `reassignToElectrician`, `updateCategoryAndReassign`, `escalatePriority`; dispatcher with `wo:update` + `task_projection:read`.

**Golden path:** (1) Dispatcher opens `<PivotKanban>` defaulted to state pivot. (2) Switches pivot via dropdown to "by skill"; columns become `[mechanical, electrical, hvac, plumbing, hazmat]`; WOs regroup in p95 ≤ 600ms (task_projection materialized). (3) Drags WO-1042 (currently in mechanical) to "electrical". (4) AVA macro `updateCategoryAndReassign` invoked: identifies nearest available electrician via §3.15 + presence; reassigns + updates `wo.category='electrical'` + writes `audit_logs.event_kind='wo.recategorized'` with `drag_macro_id`. (5) Card flips to new column; new assignee notified.

**Assertions:** pivot switch p95 ≤ 600ms (task_projection refresh + UI re-render); drag executes macro within 1.5s of release; macro provenance accessible (which AVA tool ran + result); WOs that fail macro guard (no available electrician) → reverted with toast explaining why.

**Negative tests:** drag to invalid column (e.g., to "completed" state) → refused; concurrent drag conflict (two dispatchers move same WO) → first-write-wins + second sees toast; AVA macro fails service-side → revert with structured error.

**Provenance walk:** pivot view materialized from task_projection (no new audit rows); drag macros → `ava_proposals` row with macro_name + factors + result; downstream `wo.update` → `audit_logs` rows tagged with `triggered_by_drag_macro_id`.

**Fixture path:** `apps/api/test/fixtures/marquees/mq-18-pivot-kanban.json`

---

#### 16.5.2 Marquee #19 — Dual-Axis Timeline (Asset vs Technician sync)

**Value:** Gantt with two horizontal tracks (techs on top, critical assets on bottom). Drag a PM block → AVA highlights valid tech × asset-window intersections. Eliminates Tetris-with-spreadsheets pain for OR scheduling.

**Substrate deps:** §14.1.1 `pm_schedule` + `maintenance_work_order` (PM blocks); §14.2.1 clinical-maintenance `ehr_context_link` (asset window from EHR scheduling — clinical overlay only); §14.3 facilities calendars; §14.1.6 `<DualAxisTimeline>` plugin.

**Setup fixtures:** clinical overlay installed; 4 techs with shifts + current WOs in timeline range; 6 critical assets (MRI, CT, sterilizers, autoclaves) with availability windows from `ehr_context_link` (read-only, no PHI); 3 PMs scheduled in the range.

**Golden path:** (1) Dispatcher opens `<DualAxisTimeline>` for current week. (2) Sees techs Sarah/Maria/John/Tom (top) + MRI-1/CT-1/CT-2/Sterilizer-A/Autoclave-B/X-ray-1 (bottom). (3) Drags a 4-hour MRI PM block. (4) As dragging: AVA highlights valid intersections in green (tech free + asset-window available). (5) Releases on Tuesday 14:00-18:00; PM block snaps to nearest intersection. (6) `maintenance_work_order` updated with `scheduled_at` + `assigned_technician_id`.

**Assertions:** drag intersection compute p95 ≤ 200ms (intersection set = O(techs × assets) bounded); EHR context resolved as deep-link only (NO PHI displayed); PM block placement triggers WO update via WF-1; conflict on placement (technician already booked) → snap reverts + toast.

**Negative tests:** clinical-maintenance overlay NOT installed → asset-window track shows blanks for clinical-only assets (graceful degrade); EHR context unavailable → asset window shown as "unknown — coordinate manually"; drag to past time → refused.

**Provenance walk:** drag finalization → `audit_logs.event_kind='pm.scheduled_via_timeline'`; if EHR context was consulted → `audit_logs.event_kind='ehr_context.read'` with `ehr_context_link_id` (no PHI in audit).

**Fixture path:** `apps/api/test/fixtures/marquees/mq-19-dual-axis-timeline.json`

#### 16.5.3 Marquee #20 — Triage Deck (Superhuman-style keyboard dispatch)

**Value:** Incoming unassigned WOs presented one-at-a-time as massive card with photo + nurse voice + AVA suggested tech + reasoning. Keyboard-driven: Right=accept, Left=reject, Up=escalate, Down=defer, Number=override. Dispatcher clears 50 in 2 minutes.

**Substrate deps:** §3.2 task_projection (unassigned queue); §3.7 keyboard primitives on web; §14.1.6 `<TriageDeck>` plugin; AVA WO triage tool reusing MQ-#1+#3 structuring.

**Setup fixtures:** 50 unassigned WOs in task_projection; AVA WO triage tool registered; 8 active techs with skills; dispatcher hotkey handlers tested.

**Golden path:** (1) Dispatcher opens `<TriageDeck>`. (2) Card 1: WO photo + nurse voice transcript + AVA's suggested tech "John" + reasoning ("nearest available + skill match + 18-month history with this asset class"). (3) Dispatcher hits Right Arrow → `wo.assigned` to John via WF-1 → card flips to next. (4) Card 2: Dispatcher hits Up Arrow → `priority='critical'` + escalate to manager. (5) Card 3: Dispatcher hits 5 → keyboard-driven tech selector by number; types `5` → tech-5 Maria accepted; flips. (6) Card 4: Dispatcher hits Left Arrow → AVA's suggestion rejected; queue card for more info. (7) Repeats; 50 cards cleared in 2 minutes.

**Assertions:** keypress → next card render p95 ≤ 100ms (intentional UX speed); AVA reasoning shown on every card (no black-box assignment); rejected cards re-queued with rejection reason; deterministic outcome — same fixture input + keypresses produce same final state.

**Negative tests:** AVA suggestion service down → card shows "manual triage required" + tech list; conflict (WO assigned by another dispatcher concurrently) → card refreshed + dispatcher notified; tech selector by number out-of-range → no-op + audio cue.

**Provenance walk:** each card decision → `audit_logs.event_kind='wo.triaged_via_deck'` with `keypress` + `ava_suggestion_id` + `decision`; supports replay of dispatcher's exact actions for training.

**Fixture path:** `apps/api/test/fixtures/marquees/mq-20-triage-deck.json`

#### 16.5.4 Marquee #21 — Live Command Map (spatial god-mode)

**Value:** Floorplan/campus map; WOs heat-map dots colored by priority; techs as moving blue dots from `technician_presence`. Lasso-select a cluster + drag to a tech = Major Incident batch assignment in one gesture.

**Substrate deps:** §3.2 task_projection (live queue); §3.15 spatial graph; §3.5 observation stream (real-time presence); §14.1.6 `<LiveCommandMap>` plugin; facilities overlay's `cad_drawing_link` / `ifc_space_link` (for the map source).

**Setup fixtures:** facilities overlay installed with campus map (3 floors loaded); 15 WOs scattered across floors with priorities (5 critical/4 high/6 routine); 8 techs with presence opted-in; lasso + drag gesture handlers tested.

**Golden path:** (1) Maintenance Manager opens `<LiveCommandMap>`. (2) Sees 15 colored dots (red/yellow/blue) + 8 blue moving dots (techs). (3) Identifies cluster: 15 red dots on Floor 3 (burst pipe scenario). (4) Lassos the cluster; UI shows "15 WOs selected". (5) Drags onto nearest tech's blue dot (Maria). (6) Drop triggers AVA macro: "Create Major Incident batch — assign all 15 to Maria?" + estimated time. (7) Manager confirms; macro runs: all 15 `maintenance_work_order` rows get `assigned_technician_id=Maria` + `priority='critical'` + a `major_incident_id` linking them; Maria notified.

**Assertions:** map render p95 ≤ 800ms (3 floors); lasso compute under 100ms; drag-batch macro p95 ≤ 1.5s for 15 WOs; presence updates via WebSocket (p99 latency ≤ 5s); EVERY presence dot for opted-IN techs only (privacy invariant).

**Negative tests:** tech with presence opted-OUT → NOT shown on map; major incident batch refused if any candidate WO is already in `completed` state; map source unavailable → graceful fallback to text-based list.

**Provenance walk:** lasso-drag macro → `ava_proposals` (`synthesis_kind='major_incident_batch'`); confirm → bulk `audit_logs.event_kind='wo.batch_assigned'` rows + new `major_incident_id` row; presence stream → `audit_logs.event_kind='presence.updated'` (low-frequency, opt-in only).

**Fixture path:** `apps/api/test/fixtures/marquees/mq-21-live-command-map.json`

---

#### 16.5.5 Marquee #22 — Dependency Graph (bottleneck hunting)

**Value:** Complex repairs with inter-trade dependencies (Carpentry → Plumbing → Electrical). Graph view: WOs as bubbles + dependency arrows; AVA computes critical path + badges bottleneck WO in glowing red. Shifts manager from reactive ticketing to proactive bottleneck elimination.

**Substrate deps:** §14.1.1 `work_order_dependency` join collection; §3.15 graph traversal + critical-path algorithm; §14.1.6 `<DependencyGraph>` plugin.

**Setup fixtures:** 12 WOs related to one complex repair; 8 `work_order_dependency` rows (DAG); 3 trades involved (carpentry/plumbing/electrical); AVA critical-path tool registered.

**Golden path:** (1) Maintenance Manager opens `<DependencyGraph>` view for the complex repair. (2) Sees 12 bubbles + 8 arrows; layout via §3.15 graph traversal. (3) AVA computes critical path: identifies that one $15 drywall repair (Carpentry trade) is blocking 3 high-priority plumbing tasks. (4) Critical-path WOs glow red; manager sees clearly: "drywall WO blocks 3 plumbing WOs". (5) Manager clicks bottleneck WO → opens full WO detail. (6) Reassigns to fast-track tech or splits scope to unblock.

**Assertions:** graph render p95 ≤ 700ms; critical-path compute p95 ≤ 400ms for ≤ 100 WO DAG; bottleneck identification deterministic; cycle detection refuses DAG cycle creation at insert-time (per §3.15 G16.2 facilities overlay equivalent: dag=true edge kind).

**Negative tests:** cycle in `work_order_dependency` → critical-path tool refuses; orphan WOs (no deps) → shown isolated; very large DAG (>200 WOs) → AVA suggests sub-graph filter; concurrent dependency edits → row-level conflict resolution.

**Provenance walk:** critical path compute → `ava_proposals` (`synthesis_kind='critical_path'`, factors_jsonb={dag_snapshot, bottleneck_nodes}); manager actions on bottleneck → standard WO audit; pack-validator at install ensures dependency cycles are rejected.

**Fixture path:** `apps/api/test/fixtures/marquees/mq-22-dependency-graph.json`

### 16.6 Category resets (#23-26)

#### 16.6.1 Marquee #23 — Active Entitlement Shield (reinvents Contracts)

**Value:** ServiceNow/Nuvolo Contracts are static data-entry forms; warranty leakage costs hospitals millions. HubbleWave: (a) AVA Document AI extracts MSA clauses on PDF upload; (b) at WO triage, AVA intercepts: "MRI covered under Gold Philips warranty — route to Philips?". One tap routes via §3.11 zero-login contractor flow.

**Substrate deps:** §3.8 AVA UI synthesis; canon §11 document AI for MSA PDF; §14.1.1 `master_service_agreement` + `warranty` + `service_contract`; §15.1.2 WF-2 entitlement intercept; §3.11 collaborator session.

**Setup fixtures:** Philips MRI service contract PDF (50 pages); MRI asset linked to vendor; AVA tool `extractMsaTerms(pdf)` `trust_state='execute'` (extraction Suggest but persisted-as-draft); WO incoming for the MRI.

**Golden path:** (1) Coordinator drops 50-page Philips PDF onto `master_service_agreement` collection. (2) AVA Document AI extracts: SLA = "4h response", covered_components = `["magnet", "gradient_coil", "rf_coil"]`, exclusion_list = `["software_upgrade", "site_prep"]`, response_window = 4h, parts_labor_coverage = `parts_plus_labor`. (3) Structured `master_service_agreement` row written (Preview mode → coordinator confirms). (4) Later: WO submitted for the MRI (display issue). (5) WF-2 entitlement intercept fires; AVA checks `master_service_agreement` + `warranty` against asset + failure category. (6) Match: confidence 0.92 — display issue covered. (7) Dispatcher sees inline prompt: "This MRI is under Gold Philips warranty (4h response, parts+labor covered) — route to Philips?". (8) One tap → §3.11 collaborator magic-link issued to Philips contact; vendor performs work + e-signs (MQ-#15 path).

**Assertions:** PDF extraction p95 ≤ 30s (long pages OK; this is non-real-time path); MSA terms reviewable + correctable before persist (Preview mode); entitlement intercept latency at triage p95 ≤ 200ms; warranty leakage elimination measured: 100% of warranty-covered WOs route to vendor instead of internal tech (operational measure).

**Negative tests:** MSA terms ambiguous → extraction marked low-confidence + flagged for coordinator review; warranty expired → no intercept; covered but vendor unreachable → §3.18 KillswitchService check + AVA proposes alternate vendor; vendor rejects job → falls back to WF-1 internal flow.

**Provenance walk:** PDF upload → `evidence_artifacts`; extraction → `ava_proposals` (`synthesis_kind='msa_extraction'`, factors_jsonb=full term map); MSA persist → `master_service_agreement` row + audit; entitlement intercept → `ava_proposals` (`synthesis_kind='warranty_match'`); vendor route → MQ-#15 chain.

**Fixture path:** `apps/api/test/fixtures/marquees/mq-23-entitlement-shield.json`

#### 16.6.2 Marquee #24 — Live Operational Canvas (reinvents Space Management)

**Value:** Nuvolo treats space as office-planner; HubbleWave makes it live operational. (a) `<FloorPlanRouter>` + `<LiveOperationalCanvas>` plot the most efficient walking path for multi-PM shifts (TSP-approx). (b) Invisible Space Audits — `wifi-beacon-occupancy` adapter materializes `occupancy_log` automatically with aggregate-only privacy (canon §44 + facilities G18.4).

**Substrate deps:** §3.15 graph + routeSolve; §14.3.1 `space` + `occupancy_log`; §14.3.7 `<LiveOperationalCanvas>` plugin; §14.3.7 `wifi-beacon-occupancy` adapter (aggregate-only invariant + adapter G18.4); §3.5 observation streams.

**Setup fixtures:** facilities overlay installed; full floor plan loaded; tech with 8 PMs on Floor 3 today; Wi-Fi controller adapter active for that floor; `<LiveOperationalCanvas>` WebGL fixture.

**Golden path:** (1) Tech opens `<LiveOperationalCanvas>` showing assigned 8 PMs. (2) AVA invokes routing: TSP-approx solver over `<FloorPlanRouter>` graph. (3) Returns ordered walking path between rooms + estimated time saved (e.g., 18 minutes saved over default order). (4) Path highlighted on canvas with arrows. (5) As tech walks: presence dots update in real-time. (6) Separately: Wi-Fi adapter aggregates 5-min bucket occupancy per room; `<OccupancyHeatmap>` shows utilization without ever rendering per-individual data (k-anon ≥ 3).

**Assertions:** routing compute (8 stops) p95 ≤ 800ms; presence updates < 5s lag; occupancy heatmap k-anonymity threshold (k=3) refuses to render buckets where occupant_count < 3; adapter privacy invariant: per-MAC events DISCARDED at adapter layer (asserted via fixture tests confirming `occupancy_log.source != per_individual`).

**Negative tests:** TSP solver timeout on > 30 stops → falls back to simple proximity sort; Wi-Fi adapter producing per-individual data → pack-validator G19.4 refuses install; occupancy bucket count < 3 → heatmap cell empty (k-anon enforced).

**Provenance walk:** routing → `ava_proposals` (`synthesis_kind='tsp_walking_path'`); occupancy ingestion → `observations` rows → rolled up to `occupancy_log` (aggregate only); per-bucket display attribution = `(space_id, time_bucket)` pair with count ≥ 3.

**Fixture path:** `apps/api/test/fixtures/marquees/mq-24-live-operational-canvas.json`

---

#### 16.6.3 Marquee #25 — Continuous Observations Engine (reinvents Rounds)

**Value:** Nuvolo: 50 fire extinguishers = 50 task rows = polymorphic-task-table bloat. HubbleWave: a round is NOT a task; it's a Batch Observation Session. 50 checks = 50 observations + 0 WO rows. Only failures spawn reactive WOs. Glove-Mode Rapid Fire swipe-deck.

**Substrate deps:** §14.1.1 `work_round_session` (NOT taskable) + `work_round_definition` + auto rule 20 (failed observation spawns WO); §3.5 observation streams (partitioned); §3.7 mobile + `<RoundsRunner>` swipe primitive; §15.1.13 WF-13.

**Setup fixtures:** round_definition "Floor 3 fire-extinguisher rounds" with 50 ordered asset_ids; tech assigned; AVA dynamic-round tool registered for trend-based step injection.

**Golden path:** (1) Tech opens `<RoundsRunner>` for the round; WF-13 `started`. (2) Card 1 (asset 1) appears with observation prompts. (3) Tech swipes RIGHT (Pass) → `observations` row written + auto-advance. (4) Cards 2-49 similarly. (5) Card 32: tech swipes LEFT (Fail) → spawn reactive `maintenance_work_order` via auto rule 20 + capture failure note. (6) Card 33: tech long-presses → captures measurement value. (7) Card 50 complete; tech taps "End Round" → WF-13 `completed`. (8) Reactive WOs visible in dispatcher queue; round session NOT in task_projection (per design — only the spawned WOs become tasks). (9) Dynamic Smart Rounds: AVA analyzes failure trends; if brand-X beds fail bed-rail checks across the hospital this week → AVA injects a mandatory bed-rail check into next day's standard rounds for that floor.

**Assertions:** card-swipe → next card render p95 ≤ 80ms (Glove-Mode budget); 50 observations = 50 `observations` rows + 0 WO rows for passes + N WO rows for failures (zero polymorphic-task bloat); round_completion_review (WF-13) NOT taskable (asserted via `task_projection` absence); dynamic-round injection traceable to AVA trend tool.

**Negative tests:** round abandoned (4h idle) → auto-completed with `stopping_early_reason='timeout'`; failed observation dedup window 24h prevents duplicate reactive WOs on same asset+failure_kind; dynamic-round injection without AVA confidence → no injection.

**Provenance walk:** each observation → `observations` row in §3.5; each spawned WO → `maintenance_work_orders` + `audit_logs.event_kind='wo.spawned_from_round'` with `round_session_id`; dynamic injection → `ava_proposals` (`synthesis_kind='dynamic_round_injection'`).

**Fixture path:** `apps/api/test/fixtures/marquees/mq-25-rounds.json`

#### 16.6.4 Marquee #26 — Network-to-Physical Triage (NAC Quarantine)

**Value:** ServiceNow/Nuvolo ingest OT alerts → avalanche of separate tickets. HubbleWave converges digital + physical: (a) AVA Convergence Routing proposes attaching patch-install step to upcoming PM; (b) Quarantine Lockout via NAC adapter with §3.18 dual-confirmation gate.

**Substrate deps:** §14.4.X `ot_asset_vulnerability` + `nac-quarantine` adapter; §3.18 NAC dual-confirmation; §3.8 AVA UI synthesis for convergence proposal; §15.4.4 WF-OT4 convergence routing; §15.4.2 WF-OT2 network anomaly review; §14.1.1 cross-pack write into `maintenance_work_order.checklist_items`.

**Setup fixtures:** ot-security overlay installed; vulnerability open on infusion pump 4521 with `mitigation_kind='patch'`; same pump has PM scheduled in 10 days; AVA `synthesizeConvergenceProposal` tool registered; nac-quarantine adapter active with `dual_confirmation_required=true`.

**Golden path:**
- **Path A (Convergence):** (1) OT vulnerability opens (CVE-2026-1234 on pump 4521). (2) Auto rule 2 fires (mitigation_kind=patch + upcoming PM in 14d). (3) AVA synthesizes convergence proposal: "Attach patch-install step to PM scheduled Tuesday? Saves a trip + satisfies SLA window". (4) OT Security Officer reviews + signs off (§3.6 'approval'). (5) ONE `signature_chains` row references BOTH the `ot_asset_vulnerability` AND `maintenance_work_order` (cross-pack atomicity per §15.4.4). (6) PM gains a new `checklist_item`; vulnerability auto-closed as `superseded_by_convergence`.
- **Path B (Quarantine):** (1) Active exploit detected (CVE + observed-exfil signature). (2) WF-OT2 anomaly review transitions to `quarantine_proposed`. (3) §3.18 dual-confirmation required: ot_security_officer + maintenance_manager + customer_override_flag + safety_check_passed_evidence_id. (4) Critical safety check: pump's `clinical_criticality_score=82` (life_support tier) → quarantine REFUSED with explicit message "Clinical-critical asset; manual review required before NAC quarantine". (5) For non-clinical-critical assets: both confirmations + safety evidence + override flag present → `nac-quarantine.quarantine_asset(asset_id)` invoked. (6) Asset `status='quarantined'`; mobile app shows "Do Not Use — Cybersecurity Quarantine" banner. (7) All steps in `signature_chains`.

**Assertions:** convergence proposal AVA confidence ≥0.75 to surface; cross-pack signature_chains row references both records; NAC quarantine ALWAYS requires §3.18 dual-confirmation (asserted); clinical-critical assets (`clinical_criticality_score ≥ 70` OR `life_support_designation`) refused auto-quarantine regardless of attack-signature match.

**Negative tests:** convergence proposal rejected → vulnerability stays in WF-OT1 standard flow; NAC dual-confirmation incomplete (only one confirmer) → quarantine refused with structured error; asset is clinical-critical → auto-quarantine path refused even with all guardrails present.

**Provenance walk:** convergence path → cross-pack signature_chains row + `audit_logs.event_kind='vuln.converged_with_pm'`; quarantine path → `audit_logs.event_kind='nac.quarantine_executed'` with dual-confirmer user_ids + safety_evidence_id + audit attribution AT EACH STAGE of dual-confirm. Cross-pack atomicity (§15.4.4) is the marquee #26 architectural payoff: separate platforms would need 2PC + reconciliation; overlay model does it in one transaction.

### 16.7 Back-office reinventions (#27-30)

#### 16.7.1 Marquee #27 — Predictive TCO (Active Intercept at parts-order time)

**Value:** AVA continuously computes `replacement_urgency_score` (per MQ-#17) + active intercept at parts-order: "$4k controller board for 10-year-old ultrasound — residual $6,200, TCO ratio 65%. Generate Capital Replacement Request instead?" ServiceNow's ledger never interrupts.

**Substrate deps:** MQ-#17 score; §14.1.1 `capital_replacement_request` (taskable); §15.1.15 WF-15 capital_replacement_review; §3.16 transaction_approval; AVA active-intercept tool at parts-order modal.

**Setup fixtures:** 10-year-old ultrasound asset; cumulative repair cost over 18mo = $11k; residual_value_cents = $6,200,000; replacement_urgency_score = 76 (from MQ-#17); tech opens parts-order modal to request $4k controller board.

**Golden path:** (1) Tech opens parts-order modal for $4k controller board (ultrasound). (2) AVA active-intercept tool fires: queries asset.residual_value_cents + recent repair spend; computes `repair_cost_total + new_part_cost / remaining_residual_value = (11000 + 4000) / 6200 = 2.42` ratio. (3) Threshold check: customer policy `capital_replacement_threshold=0.6`; current ratio 2.42 >> threshold. (4) Modal interrupts: "This repair is $4,000; cumulative cost + this repair = $15,000; remaining residual value = $6,200 (TCO ratio 2.42). Generate Capital Replacement Request to Director instead?". (5) Tech approves intercept → `capital_replacement_request` row inserted via auto rule 21 + Maintenance Manager notification. (6) WF-15 capital_replacement_review proceeds (director approval via §3.16 + procurement_proposal generation chain to WF-16). (7) If tech overrides intercept ("repair anyway") → audited with reason code; parts order proceeds.

**Assertions:** parts-order modal → active intercept compute p95 ≤ 400ms; ratio computation deterministic; threshold configurable per customer policy; intercept override audited with reason code; cross-workflow chain (MQ-#27 → WF-15 → WF-16 → §3.16) all explicit `workflow_complete:` triggers.

**Negative tests:** asset with no residual_value (new install < 30d) → no intercept; replacement_urgency_score below decision threshold → no intercept; warranty-covered asset → MQ-#23 entitlement intercept fires first (different path); intercept override without reason code → blocked.

**Provenance walk:** parts-order intercept → `ava_proposals` (`synthesis_kind='tco_active_intercept'`, factors_jsonb=ratio_breakdown + threshold + decision); intercept-accept → `capital_replacement_request` row + cascade; intercept-override → `audit_logs.event_kind='tco_intercept.overridden'` with reason code.

#### 16.7.2 Marquee #28 — Autonomous JIT Procurement

**Value:** AVA reads next 30-90 days of `pm_schedule` + historical break-fix consumption + supplier lead times → drafts `procurement_proposal` (AVA-pre-filled shopping carts per vendor). Procurement Manager: Approve All / Edit / Skip. "Stock hit zero" Nuvolo failure mode eliminated.

**Substrate deps:** §14.1.1 `procurement_proposal` (taskable) + `pm_schedule` + `parts_consumption` + `vendor`; §15.1.16 WF-16 procurement_proposal_approval (marquee #28); §3.16 transaction_approval if total > threshold; §14.1.6 `<ProcurementProposalCart>` plugin.

**Setup fixtures:** 30 PMs scheduled in next 60 days; 18 months of parts_consumption data; 5 vendors with MSA rate cards; AVA JIT procurement tool `proposeJitCart(horizon_days, scope)` `trust_state='preview'`.

**Golden path:** (1) AVA scheduled tool runs nightly: reads PMs + consumption history + lead times. (2) Drafts `procurement_proposal` rows grouped by vendor: e.g., "Philips: 12 filters + 6 controller boards + 3 sensor packs = $18,400". Each line carries provenance: which PMs and historical failures justified the quantity. (3) Procurement Manager opens `<ProcurementProposalCart>` next morning. (4) Reviews cart line-by-line; sees provenance per line. (5) Taps "Approve All" → WF-16 transitions `proposed → approved_to_po → po_generated`; `purchase_order` rows created per vendor with `source='ava_jit_proposal'`. (6) Or: "Edit" specific lines; "Skip" others. Partial-approve cycles back to `reviewed` state per WF-16.

**Assertions:** nightly JIT compute completes for 30 PMs + 5 vendors in p95 ≤ 60s; provenance attached per line (which PMs + which historical consumption); `purchase_order.source='ava_jit_proposal'` for fully-AVA-approved lines; partial-approve loop functional.

**Negative tests:** insufficient parts_consumption history → AVA refuses (insufficient confidence); vendor unavailable → line marked `vendor_unavailable_replanned`; PM canceled mid-proposal → AVA refreshes cart; total exceeds approval threshold → WF-3 transaction_approval gate fires.

**Provenance walk:** JIT compute → `ava_proposals` (`synthesis_kind='jit_procurement_proposal'`, factors_jsonb=per-line {pm_ids_contributing, consumption_history_ids, lead_time_days}); approval → WF-16 chain → `purchase_order` rows with `source='ava_jit_proposal'`. "stock hit zero" failure mode never appears in audit because it's prevented.

**Fixture path:** `apps/api/test/fixtures/marquees/mq-28-jit-procurement.json`

#### 16.7.3 Marquee #29 — AI-Enforced Vendor Invoice Reconciliation

**Value:** Vendor PDF dropped at §3.11 contractor portal → AVA Document AI extracts billed-hours + line-items + rates → cross-references `time_on_site` + MSA rate card + `parts_consumption` → match or `invoice_discrepancy`. AP sees only reconciled/approved-with-variance; stop being bottleneck.

**Substrate deps:** §14.1.1 `vendor_invoice` (taskable) + `master_service_agreement` (rate card from MQ-#23 extraction) + `parts_consumption`; §3.16 three_way_match_record; §15.1.17 WF-17 vendor_invoice_reconciliation; §14.1.6 `<InvoiceDiscrepancyBoard>` plugin; canon §11 Document AI.

**Setup fixtures:** vendor's 4-page invoice PDF dropped via MQ-#15 contractor portal; matching WO with `time_on_site=3.5h` + `parts_consumption` for 2 controller boards; MSA rate card with `labor_rate=$150/h` + `parts_markup=10%`.

**Golden path:** (1) Vendor uploads invoice PDF via §3.11 magic-link portal. (2) `vendor_invoice` row created in `status='received'`. (3) Auto rule 17 fires WF-17. (4) AVA Document AI extracts: `billed_hours=4.0`, `billed_parts=[ctrl_board:$425×2]`, `billed_total=$1,495`. (5) Cross-reference: time_on_site=3.5h × $150 = $525; parts_consumption=2 boards × $400 (MSA rate) = $800; expected_total=$1,325. (6) Variance = $1,495 - $1,325 = +$170 (12.8%); tolerance per pack policy = 5% → exceeds. (7) `status` transitions to `discrepancy_flagged`. (8) WF-17 enqueues human review on `<InvoiceDiscrepancyBoard>`. (9) AP clerk reviews; sees AVA explanation: "0.5h time mismatch; parts markup mismatch ($25 over MSA rate)". (10) AP clerk requests vendor clarification via contractor portal OR approves with variance reason code. (11) Approved-with-variance → §3.16 three_way_match_record written; status `approved → paid`.

**Assertions:** PDF extraction p95 ≤ 25s; cross-reference compute p95 ≤ 600ms; discrepancy auto-flag when variance > pack tolerance; AP clerk sees AVA reasoning + linked WO time/parts data; three_way_match_record written on approval.

**Negative tests:** invoice references unknown asset/WO → flagged `unknown_reference` + manual review; vendor not in MSA → discrepancy with reason `no_rate_card_match`; duplicate invoice number → dedup at received state.

**Provenance walk:** PDF → `evidence_artifacts`; extraction → `ava_proposals` (`synthesis_kind='invoice_extraction'`); cross-reference → `ava_proposals` (`synthesis_kind='invoice_reconciliation'`, factors_jsonb=full breakdown); status transitions → `vendor_invoice` audit; approval → `three_way_match_record` + `audit_logs.event_kind='inv.three_way_match'`.

**Fixture path:** `apps/api/test/fixtures/marquees/mq-29-invoice-reconciliation.json`

#### 16.7.4 Marquee #30 — Fleet-as-Asset (asset is an asset)

**Value:** ServiceNow/Nuvolo ship Fleet Management as separate module. HubbleWave: vehicles are `asset` rows with `asset_type='vehicle'` + telematics capability binding to §3.5 streams. Mileage-based PM auto-fires. Fault codes → reactive WO with AVA-suggested fix. Proves §17.5 customization-contract claim.

**Substrate deps:** §14.1.1 `asset` (with `asset_class='vehicle'`); §14.1.7 `obd2-telematics-feed` adapter; §3.5 observation streams (engine_rpm/coolant_temp/mileage/gps_lat/gps_lon/fault_code); §3.3 utilization-trigger PM generation; §15.1.18 WF-18 fleet_telematics_to_pm; MQ-#4 deterministic parts staging.

**Setup fixtures:** fire-rescue truck asset with `asset_class='vehicle'`; obd2-telematics-feed adapter active for the truck's VIN; pm_schedule "oil change every 5000 miles" with utilization-trigger; current mileage 4,950; vehicle currently driving (live observation stream).

**Golden path:** (1) Truck's OBD2 streams mileage observations every 30s into `observations` (subject=truck asset, stream_kind='mileage'). (2) Crosses 5,000 mile threshold. (3) §3.5 alert fires; WF-18 `threshold_breached → pm_schedule_consulted → wo_generated`. (4) `maintenance_work_order` created (oil change PM); WF-4 idempotency on `(pm_schedule_id, mileage_snapshot)`. (5) MQ-#4 deterministic parts staging runs: reserves oil filter from stock. (6) Mechanic notified. (7) Separately: truck reports fault code DTC P0420 (catalyst inefficiency); auto rule emits `runtime_anomaly` + spawns reactive WO with AVA suggested fix linked to catalytic converter parts catalog.

**Assertions:** mileage threshold → WO generation p95 ≤ 8s of observation arrival; idempotency on duplicate mileage observation (same value) → suppresses duplicate WO; obd2 adapter conforms to §3.13 simulator fixtures; vehicle PMs use EXACT same maintenance-core schema as MRI PMs (zero new tables added — §17.5 proof asserted).

**Negative tests:** OBD2 feed interrupted > 1h → gap detection alarm + fleet_manager notified; meter rollover (e.g., mileage reset) → handled by WF-4 idempotency snapshot; vehicle out-of-service before WO → WO marked `aborted` cleanly.

**Provenance walk:** OBD2 observation → `observations` row; threshold breach → `audit_logs.event_kind='fleet.threshold_breached'` + WF-18 chain; WO generation → `audit_logs.event_kind='pm.wo_generated'` with `triggered_by_stream='mileage'`; fault code → `runtime_anomaly` row + reactive WO; ZERO new tables — fleet uses maintenance-core's asset/PM/observation primitives.

**Fixture path:** `apps/api/test/fixtures/marquees/mq-30-fleet-as-asset.json`

### 16.8 Edge reinventions (#31-35)

#### 16.8.1 Marquee #31 — Semantic Recall Quarantine

**Value:** ServiceNow/Nuvolo do dumb text-matching → recalls miss matches on messy data (typos, model variants, rebrandings). HubbleWave: AVA vector-search semantic similarity against asset metadata; "Philips Model X" matches "Philps Mod-X" with confidence scores. Confidence >0.85 auto-quarantine + recall_response; 0.70-0.85 surface for biomed confirm; <0.70 notification only.

**Substrate deps:** §3.14 vector match (semantic similarity); §14.2.1 `ecri_recall` + `recall_response` (clinical overlay); §15.2.3 WF-OC3 ecri_advisory_response; §14.1.6 `<SemanticRecallMatchBoard>` plugin.

**Setup fixtures:** clinical overlay installed; 200 medical-device assets with varying spelling of "Philips Model X" (4 variants); ECRI recall just published: `"Philips Model X infusion pumps — Class II"`; §3.14 `vector_index_entry` pre-built for asset metadata.

**Golden path:** (1) ECRI feed adapter ingests recall → `ecri_recall` row. (2) WF-OC3 `ecri_advisory_received → asset_query_run`. (3) AVA invokes §3.14 vector search over asset corpus for semantic similarity to recall description. (4) Returns ranked matches: `[asset_4521 (0.94), asset_4527 (0.91), asset_4513 (0.78), asset_4509 (0.65)]`. (5) Confidence >0.85 (assets 4521, 4527) → auto-tag "Do Not Use — Active Recall" + auto-spawn `recall_response` taskable rows; dispatcher to biomed group. (6) Confidence 0.70-0.85 (asset 4513) → surface on `<SemanticRecallMatchBoard>` for biomed engineer one-tap confirm. (7) Confidence <0.70 (asset 4509) → notification only; no auto-action. (8) Biomed engineer confirms asset 4513 (sees it IS a Model X variant) → adds to recall_response queue.

**Assertions:** vector match compute p95 ≤ 1.5s for 200 assets; confidence bands consistent with §3.14 thresholds; auto-quarantine writes `do_not_use_banner` flag on mobile app; biomed-confirmed matches join recall_response queue with `confidence_at_match` recorded.

**Negative tests:** zero matches above any threshold → no action + advisory marked `no_assets_affected`; manufacturer dispute (recall withdrawn) → cascade-cancel all recall_response rows + WF-OC3 transitions to `superseded`; AVA service down → fallback to keyword match (degraded mode noted in audit).

**Provenance walk:** vector search → `ava_proposals` (`synthesis_kind='semantic_recall_match'`, factors_jsonb=ranked candidates with confidence + matched terms); auto-quarantine → `audit_logs.event_kind='asset.recall_quarantined'` with `recall_id` + `confidence_at_match`; biomed confirms → `audit_logs.event_kind='recall.human_confirmed'`.

**Fixture path:** `apps/api/test/fixtures/marquees/mq-31-semantic-recall.json`

#### 16.8.2 Marquee #32 — Graph-Native Reverse Calibration Traceability (Analyzer Blast Radius)

**Value:** Fluke Analyzer goes out of tolerance → every patient monitor it calibrated in last 6 months potentially has bad readings. ServiceNow/Nuvolo report-builders make this nightmarish; HubbleWave's observation substrate makes it a one-click query. Compliance officer's worst nightmare becomes 30-second query.

**Substrate deps:** §3.15 graph traversal + blastRadius; §14.2.1 `calibration_certificate` + `inspection` (each calibration writes both an inspection row AND a graph edge `instrument_calibrated_asset`); §14.1.6 `<AnalyzerBlastRadiusBoard>` plugin in `ws_biomed_engineer`; mass `recall_response` cascade.

**Setup fixtures:** clinical overlay installed; Fluke Analyzer asset with 500 historical calibrations in last 6 months; §3.15 `relationship_edge` rows with `edge_kind='instrument_calibrated_asset'` linking Fluke → 500 patient monitors; Fluke just went out of tolerance during its own self-calibration.

**Golden path:** (1) Fluke calibration certificate flags `requires_adjustment=true` (per §15.1.5 WF-5 edge case). (2) Biomed engineer opens Fluke's asset detail. (3) Clicks "Blast Radius — Analyze impact". (4) `<AnalyzerBlastRadiusBoard>` invokes §3.15 blastRadius(startNode=Fluke, edge_kind='instrument_calibrated_asset', depth=1, time_window=180d). (5) Returns 500 patient monitor assets touched in last 6 months. (6) Bulk action: "Suspend clinical status on all"; `<DoNotUseBanner>` flag flips on each; reactive `maintenance_work_order` (re-calibrate) auto-generated for each. (7) Total: 1 query + 1 bulk action + 500 reactive WOs + 1 high-severity audit row.

**Assertions:** blastRadius compute p95 ≤ 1.5s for 500-node neighborhood; bulk suspend writes 500 asset.status updates + 500 reactive WOs in ONE transaction; `<DoNotUseBanner>` flag visible on mobile within 8s; signature_chains records mass-suspend as single high-severity decision.

**Negative tests:** edge data missing for some calibrations → those assets surface with "unknown calibration source" flag rather than silent omission; bulk-suspend without §3.6 signature → blocked; concurrent biomed engineer running blast radius → second sees first's results.

**Provenance walk:** blastRadius → `ava_proposals` (`synthesis_kind='blast_radius_query'`, factors_jsonb=traversal_path + matched_nodes); bulk suspend → `audit_logs.event_kind='asset.mass_suspended'` with `triggered_by_fluke_id` + `affected_asset_count`; 500 reactive WOs → bulk WF-1 audit chain; one high-severity AccessAuditPort.logSecurityEvent.

**Fixture path:** `apps/api/test/fixtures/marquees/mq-32-analyzer-blast-radius.json`

#### 16.8.3 Marquee #33 — AVA Auto-Commissioning (Capital Project Handover)

**Value:** Contractor hands facilities a messy 5,000-row Excel after construction. ServiceNow/Nuvolo customers spend 6 months on manual entry. HubbleWave: drag-drop spreadsheet → AVA normalizes (naming conventions, asset_type categorization, location inference) → reviewable grid → bulk publish. The 6-month commissioning lag disappears.

**Substrate deps:** §3.17 import primitive (`import_batch` + `import_row`); §14.1.1 `asset_import_batch` (thin alias over §3.17); §15.1.19 WF-19 asset_import_commissioning; §14.1.6 `<AssetImportWizard>` plugin; AVA spreadsheet normalization tool reusing canon §11 document AI.

**Setup fixtures:** facilities manager with `import:batch:ingest` + `import:batch:publish`; 5,000-row sample CSV with varying column names + naming inconsistencies; AVA tool `asset_csv_normalizer` registered (pack maintenance-core); existing asset_type taxonomy + location codes seeded.

**Golden path:** (1) Facilities manager drag-drops CSV into `<AssetImportWizard>`. (2) Upload via §3.12 storage → `import_batch` row created in `status='ingested'`. (3) Worker invokes `ImportNormalizationProcessor`. (4) For each row, AVA normalizer runs: maps column variants ("HVAC-1A" / "hvac_1a" / "HVAC#1A" → standardized); categorizes asset_type (e.g., "Variable Refrigerant Volume System" → `asset_type='hvac_vrv'`); infers location_id from heuristics (column headers + value patterns); writes `ava_normalized_payload` + `ava_confidence_per_field`. (5) Batch transitions `normalizing → reviewable`. (6) Manager opens review grid; sees per-row AVA confidence; corrects 50 ambiguous rows. (7) Taps "Publish All Accepted" → WF-19 transitions `reviewable → publishing → published` in ONE DB transaction. (8) 4,950 `asset` rows + 4,950 `asset_meter` rows created (per WF-19 pack-specific side effect). (9) Atomic publish: all-or-nothing; if any row fails, ALL roll back. (10) 24h rollback window per §3.17.

**Assertions:** normalization compute for 5,000 rows p95 ≤ 5 minutes (async, batched); review grid render p95 ≤ 2s; publish operation atomic (verified by partial-failure injection test); rollback within 24h works (per §3.17 customer policy override).

**Negative tests:** asset_type unmappable for some rows → flagged as `requires_review`; bulk publish refused if any row `status='pending'` → `UNREVIEWED_ROWS_EXIST`; concurrent publish by two facility managers → second blocked at `import_batch.status='publishing'` lock; rollback past 24h → `ROLLBACK_WINDOW_EXPIRED`.

**Provenance walk:** CSV → `evidence_artifacts` (the raw file retained); each row's normalization → `ava_proposals` (`synthesis_kind='asset_csv_normalize'`, per-row `factors_jsonb`); publish → `audit_logs.event_kind='import_batch.published'` + per-row `audit_logs.event_kind='asset.commissioned_via_import'` with `import_batch_id`; rollback (if used) → high-severity audit per §3.17.

**Fixture path:** `apps/api/test/fixtures/marquees/mq-33-auto-commissioning.json`

#### 16.8.4 Marquee #34 — Joint Commission EoC Auditor Proof (extension of #14)

**Value:** Auditor Kiosk gets a Live Operational Canvas mode for Joint Commission EoC audit. Tap any room → see every PM done in that room + every inspection with **Merkle root hashes** from `signature_chains` for each. Tap fire-door → signed inspection row + Merkle proof binding to chain head. Cryptographic proof, not screenshots of PDFs.

**Substrate deps:** MQ-#14 Auditor Kiosk (kiosk session); §14.3.7 `<LiveOperationalCanvas>` (Floor plan WebGL); §3.6 signature_chains (Merkle batch from §13.7 batched signing); §3.15 graph; clinical+facilities overlays.

**Setup fixtures:** kiosk session for auditor; 200 inspections in last 6mo across 50 rooms; each inspection signed via §3.6 Merkle batch (auditor can inspect 50 inspections under one root); fire-door inspection example with cryptographic chain.

**Golden path:** (1) Auditor's iPad in `ws_auditor_kiosk` audience='kiosk'. (2) Switch to "EoC Audit" mode (registered as plugin in `ws_auditor_kiosk`). (3) Floor plan renders with PM-completion heat overlay (color = days since last PM per room). (4) Auditor taps Room 312. (5) Workspace shows: 3 PMs completed last 6mo + 2 inspections (fire door + life-safety device). (6) Auditor taps fire-door inspection row. (7) Sees: inspector_user_id + inspection_outcome + reason_code + `signature_chains.hash_hex` + `signature_chains.merkle_root_chain_entry_id` (if part of a batch) + `<MerkleProofViewer>` showing the leaf-hash → root path. (8) Auditor verifies cryptographic proof: leaf bytes (canonical signer/action/timestamp/payload_hash) re-hashed → matches chain row; chain row links forward to current head. (9) Auditor downloads CSV with all hashes for offline verification.

**Assertions:** Merkle proof render p95 ≤ 1s per inspection; cryptographic verification client-side (auditor's own re-hash of leaf bytes matches stored hash); CSV download includes hash columns; kiosk audience read-only constraint enforced (any modification attempt → §28 403).

**Negative tests:** signature_chains entry tampered (admin tries to edit signature row) → DB-level CHECK constraint refuses; Merkle proof verification fails on a single row → escalation flag; chain row's predecessor hash mismatch → integrity alert.

**Provenance walk:** Auditor tap → `audit_logs.event_kind='kiosk.eoc_audit.viewed'`; CSV download → `audit_logs.event_kind='kiosk.audit_export'` with row_count + hashes_included; the proof itself is self-contained (cryptographic, not auditable beyond the chain).

**Fixture path:** `apps/api/test/fixtures/marquees/mq-34-joint-commission-eoc.json`

#### 16.8.5 Marquee #35 — Cryptographic Key Custody & Locksmithing

**Value:** Nuvolo/ServiceNow ship simple `keys` table. HubbleWave treats physical keys as restricted assets with full regulated-action ledger: `key_record` + `key_assignment` (taskable + regulated; every issuance signed) + `unrecovered_key_flag` (auto-generated on employee termination). Master-key requires additional supervisor co-sign.

**Substrate deps:** §14.1.1 `key_record` + `key_assignment` (taskable + regulated) + `unrecovered_key_flag`; §3.6 e-signatures + Merkle batch; §15.1.20 WF-20 key_revocation_on_termination; §3.15 graph (key → opens_locks); §14.1.6 `<KeyCustodyLedger>` plugin.

**Setup fixtures:** 200 key_record rows (master + sub-master + operating + control classes); 80 active key_assignments; HR `users.status='terminated'` event for a tech with 3 keys (1 master + 2 operating); security officer with `key_assignment:create` + `key_record:manage` permissions; lock-change procurement workflow registered.

**Golden path:**
- **Path A (Issuance):** (1) Security officer issues operating key to new tech via `<KeyCustodyLedger>`. (2) `key_assignment` row created (taskable, regulated). (3) §3.6 signature required from holder + from issuer (dual-sign). (4) For master keys: ADDITIONAL supervisor co-sign required (3 signatures total). (5) `signature_chains` row binds the custody transfer. (6) `key_record.status='issued'`.
- **Path B (HR Termination):** (1) HR system fires `users.status='terminated'` event for tech holding 3 keys. (2) WF-20 auto rule 15 invoked. (3) For each open `key_assignment` for that user: emit `unrecovered_key_flag` row (taskable) + create recovery WO + notify Security Officer. (4) Master-key flag fires CASCADING IMPACT: `<KeyCustodyLedger>` traverses §3.15 graph (key → opens_locks); every lock the master key opens flagged with "Pending Rekey"; bulk rekey procurement workflow auto-created. (5) For operating keys: 7-day escalation: if not recovered by day 7, transition to `escalated_to_lock_change` + procurement workflow for replacement lock.
- **Path C (Recovery):** (1) Tech returns key physically. (2) Security officer confirms recovery on `<KeyCustodyLedger>`. (3) §3.6 closure signature + dual-confirm if master key. (4) `key_record.status='returned'`; `key_assignment.actual_return_at` stamped; `unrecovered_key_flag.cleared_at` stamped.

**Assertions:** key issuance → audit trail complete (issuer + holder + supervisor signatures for master); HR termination → auto-recovery flow fires within 60s; master-key cascade traverses §3.15 graph correctly (every connected lock flagged); 7-day escalation timer fires + transitions states; audit query "every master-key transfer this quarter with signer identity + reason code" runs in <5s.

**Negative tests:** key issuance without signatures → blocked; master-key issuance without supervisor co-sign → blocked; HR termination of user with no active key_assignments → no-op; concurrent recovery attempt by two security officers → first-write-wins.

**Provenance walk:** issuance → `key_assignment` row + 2-3 `electronic_signatures` (chain via §3.6 batch); HR termination → cascade `audit_logs.event_kind='key.flagged_on_termination'` with `master_key_cascade_count` per unrecovered_key_flag; recovery → `audit_logs.event_kind='key.recovered'` + `unrecovered_key_flag.cleared_at`; escalation → `audit_logs.event_kind='key.escalated_to_lock_change'` + linked procurement_workflow_id; audit can query "every master-key transfer + every unrecovered_key incident this quarter" via partial indexes on key_record.

Master implementation plan at `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-16-clinical-facilities-asset-maintenance-implementation.md` cross-references them in execution order.

### 13.22 Convention for spec doc filenames (superseded by mega-spec-inline approach)

### 13.23 What's left to do BEFORE code starts

1. **Convert this plan file** to `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-16-clinical-facilities-asset-maintenance-design.md` (the architecture spec — already drafted; post-ExitPlanMode it's a `git mv` + commit).
2. **Write 17 more substrate spec docs** (§3.2-§3.18), each following the §13.2 template above.
3. **Write 4 pack spec docs**, each enumerating every collection's tables/columns/migrations/services + every workflow's state machine + every plugin component skeleton.
4. **Write the master implementation plan** at `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-16-...-implementation.md` cross-referencing the spec docs into PR sequence by gate.
5. **§1.1 prerequisites cleared** before Phase 0 can start: W2 Stream 1 role-code/role-id auth resolution + migration/package coherence + scanner baseline.

Estimated effort for the implementation-spec work: **~6-8 working weeks** for one engineer + AI agents to produce the full spec set before the 50-week build clock starts. This is the cost of designing thoroughly before coding — and it's what prevents the architecture plan from quietly becoming "custom platform code wearing a pack costume" during execution.

---

**End of plan. Ready for user review. After approval, the next deliverables are the spec docs listed in §13.4 and §13.5 — written one at a time using §13.2 as the template.**
